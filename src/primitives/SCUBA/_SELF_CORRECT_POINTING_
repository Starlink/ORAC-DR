=head1 NAME

_SELF_CORRECT_POINTING_ - determine pointing error and apply it

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For bright sources that are known to be centred on the array
(eg maps of calibrators or pointing observations) it is possible
to determine a pointing error and apply it to the data without
referring to additional pointing observations. This allows
calibrator maps to be coadded without smearing the beam (assuming
the beam is not changing shape due to dish warming).

This primitive rebins some data in AZ coordinates, determines
the centroid offsets and then stores the offsets in the frame
for subsequent use when rebinning.

It does not attempt to rebin each integration separately
in order to account for pointing drifts within a single
observation. This is only relevant for long observations
(usually bright sources are only observed for a long time
when we are testing the track model).
