=head1 NAME

_CALC_PHOT_RESULT_ - process photometry data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Process photometry integrations in the desired method. Simply
extracts the data for each observed bolometer, processes it
as required and stores to disk. Does not calculate the result.

=head1 TASKS

SURF: SCUPHOT

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are allowed:

=over 4

=item B<METHOD>

Analysis method. Can be C<AVERAGE>, C<PARABOLA> or C<SAMPLES>.
Default is C<AVERAGE>. See the SCUPHOT entry in the SURF manual for
more information on these options.

=head1 NOTES

The peak derived from data processed using PARABOLA fitting will be
different to that derived from AVERAGE or SAMPLES. To overcome this,
all data derived from PARABOLA fitting must be scaled by an amount related
to the beam size (essentially correcting for the difference of a
Gaussian between the peak and the average of the nine points in a grid
layed on the peak).  This is especially important at 450 microns since
there is an offset between the arrays. Assuming a 1 arcsec offset from
the source peak (average pointing error at 850 microns and the array
misalignment at 450 microns) gives correction factors of:

  850 microns:  0.918
  450 microns:  0.719

This correction must, currently, be applied after the data have been
reduced.
