=head1 NAME

_REMOVE_SKY_NOISE_SCAN_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates and removes sky noise by calculating a source model.
Currently works for jiggle map data only.


=head1 TASKS

SURF: CALCSKY, REMSKY

=head1 OPTIONS

None

=head1 NOTES

This is a group method since the result improves as more data
are included.

Note that since this method modifies files that have already been
processed the template() method is used to find out what the
file name was at the current stage of data processing.
