=head1 NAME

_DOME_FLAT_BPM_ -- Form a bad pixel mask from some dome flat exposures.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dome flat exposures are weeded out to make sure they are neither over nor under
exposed. The lower and upper cutoff values are defined as input parameters. If
there are still at least 2 frames left over then they are combined into a mean
dome flat field frame. The mean frame is displayed and then the frames are used
to form a bad pixel mask.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item MIN = float (Given)

The minimum number of counts per channel before we'll accept a frame for further
consideration

=item MAX = float (Given)

The maximum number of counts before we consider the frame to be over exposed.
