=head1 NAME
 
_INTERLEAVE_DITHER_SKYSUB_STEER_ -- Set up flags defining when we are allowed
to begin combining dither and interleave sequences.  
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION
 
This is a steering primitive for several recipes where dithering is done. 
If the current group was done as a tile and if the caller requests that 
things be done on a tile basis (i.e. if we're doing a sky subtraction where
the sky estimate is done over the whole of the tile) then this routine will
not allow any dithering or interleaving until we have all through files for
the tile. If either there is not tile being observed or we don't want to reduce
on a tile level, then it allows for interleaving and dithering when all of
the files for a current jitter are in. The flags that determine whether
the tile or jitter is complete is set by the routine _STEER_GROUPINGS_.
 
=head1 ARGUMENTS
 
=over 4

=item DO_TLEVEL = int (Given)

If set, then the reduction is being done on the tile level.
 
=head1 NOTES
 
Sets the following items in the $Grp->uhdr structure:

=over 4

=item ALLOWED_TO_INTERLEAVE

If set we can interleave the microstep sequences in the current tile

=item ALLOWED_TO_DITHER

If set, we can do a dither combination on each of the jitter sequences in the
current tile.
