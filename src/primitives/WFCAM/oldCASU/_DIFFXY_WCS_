=head1 NAME

_DIFFXY_WCS_ -- Find the offsets between images using WCS values in the headers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive cycles through all of the images in a group.  The dither offset
is calculated using the WCS stored in the FITS headers.  All offsets are 
relative to the first image in the group.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

None

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The output results are stored in the uhdr components XOFF_WCS and YOFF_WCS for
each frame in the group.
