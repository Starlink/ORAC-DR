=head1 NAME

_APM_ -- Do an object detection using an APM type algorithm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive cycles through all of the image extensions in an input file
and creates a catalogue of objects on it using PSB's APM algorithm. The
output catalogue is a binary FITS table and is called after the input file
with a prefix attatched. This name is written to the extension
and the primary uhdr as OBJTAB.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item PREFIX = char (Given)

The prefix to attatch to the input file name in order to form an output file
name.

=item PNOP = int (Given)

The minimum number of pixels for a detection to be considered an object

=item BGFILE = char (Given)

A file name for the background map.  If it's left blank then this file won't be
kept.

=item MASKFILE = char (Given)

A file name for an object mask.  Any pixel that forms part of a detected object
will be set in the mask.

=item VERBOSE = int (Given)

If set, then verbose output will be written to STDOUT.

=item THRESH = float (Given)

The detection threshold. If negative, this is in units of background sigma 
above sky.  If positive, it is in units of actual data values above sky.

=item GRID = int (Given)

The blocking factor to be used in forming the background map

=item DITCHTAB = int (Given)

If set, then the output table will be thrown away.  This is used if the event 
that all you are interested in is creating an object mask.
