=head1 NAME

_JITTER_SKYSUB_EXCL_ -- Estimate and subtract sky estimates by combining images
from all jitter and microstep images from a jitter sequence except for the
frame which is being background subtracted.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This routine only is invoked once we have all the images for a particular 
jitter sequence. Once we do, all of the files in the jitter sequence are used
to form a mean sky frame except for the frame we want to background correct. 
Thus each frame in the jitter sequence will have its own associated sky frame.
