# Name:
#    _SUBTRACT_SKY_CHOP_SKY_
#
# Purpose:
#    Subtracts a sky background for CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive subtracts a sky background from the target frames, 
#    in the whole observation.  Each sky background is interpolated
#    between the levels of the bracketing sky frames about each target
#    frame.  It reports each successful sky subtraction, the frames
#    concerned, and the value of the background subtracted.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when the
#    steering header SUBTRACT_SKY is true.
#    -  All the target frames within the current cycle, as given by
#    steering header CYCLE_NUMBER, are sky-subtracted.
#    -  The sky levels are stored by reference in the SKY_LEVELS user
#    header of the reference frame.  The index of the first of the pair
#    of levels in SKY_LEVELS is the index of the frame given by steering
#    header TARGET_NUMBER.
#    -  The subtraction assumes the same exposure time for the sky and
#    object frame.
#    -  Each sky-subtracted image can be displayed.
#    -  The frames' titles are each propagated.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Sky-subtracted target frames each inheriting its corresponding
#    input frame's name but with the _ss suffix.

# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: CSUB.

_SUBTRACT_SKY_CHOP_SKY_ -- Subtracts a sky background for CHOP_SKY_JITTER recipes.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive subtracts a sky background from the target frames, 
in the whole observation.  Each sky background is interpolated
between the levels of the bracketing sky frames about each target
frame.  It reports each successful sky subtraction, the frames
concerned, and the value of the background subtracted.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when the
steering header SUBTRACT_SKY is true.

=item *

All the target frames within the current cycle, as given by steering
header CYCLE_NUMBER, are sky-subtracted.

=item *

The sky levels are stored by reference in the SKY_LEVELS user header
of the reference frame.  The index of the first of the pair of
levels in SKY_LEVELS is the index of the frame given by steering
header TARGET_NUMBER.

=item *

The subtraction assumes the same exposure time for the sky and
object frame.

=item *

Each sky-subtracted image can be displayed.

=item *

The frames' titles are each propagated.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

Sky-subtracted target frames each inheriting its corresponding
input frame's name but with the _ss suffix.
