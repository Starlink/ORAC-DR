=head1 NAME

_ADD_AUTO_ASTROMETRY_ -- Performs automated astrometric corrections.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive automatically corrects astrometry for a given observation.
It does so by downloading a catalogue from a source (typically 2MASS),
detects objects in the observation, correlates between the two catalogues,
and calculates an astrometric solution.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for infrared imaging instruments.

=item *

Processing only occurs when the steering header ADD_ASTROMETRY is true.

=item *

Processing occurs on the current Group object.

=item *

Astrometric correction will probably fail if fewer than five objects
are detected in the frame. Should this occur, the original WCS will
be retained.

=item *

Should an astrometric solution be found, the WCS in the current
Group will be overwritten with the solution.
