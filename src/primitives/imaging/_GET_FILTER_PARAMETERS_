# Name:
#    _GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Returns UKIRT near-infrared filter characteristics.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive using a switch structure to return two characteristics
#    or relating to the UKIRT near-infrared imaging filters through arguments.
#    Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.
#
#  Arguments:
#    EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)
#       The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
#       default is 0.0.
#    WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Returned)
#       The name of the waveband (I, Z, Y, J, H, K, L, M) within the
#       catalogue of standards most appropriate for the current frame's
#       filter.  If the filter is not recognised, WAVEBAND returns " ".
#    WAVELENGTH = REAL (Returned)
#       The central wavelength of the waveband returned by the WAVEBAND
#       argument, in microns.  If the filter is not recognised, WAVELENGTH
#       returns 0.0.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UKIRT near-infrared photometry.
#    -  The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.
#    -  The recognised filters have names beginning J, H, K, L, L',
#    M, I, Z, and Y.
#    -  The mean extinction coefficients are: I: 0.07; Z: 0.03; Y: 0.06;
#    J: 0.08; H: 0.03; K: 0.07; L: 0.10; L':0.09, and M: 0.30.  Zero
#    extinction applies to any other filter.

=head1 NAME

_GET_FILTER_PARAMETERS_ -- Returns UKIRT near-infrared filter characteristics.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive using a switch structure to return two characteristics
or relating to the UKIRT near-infrared imaging filters through arguments.
Default values are returned if the filter is not recognised.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item EXTINCTION = REAL (Returned)

The approximate mean atmospheric extinction for the filter.  The
default is 0.0.

=item WAVEBAND = CHARACTER (Returned)

The name of the waveband (I<I, Z, Y, J, H, K, L, M>) within the
catalogue of standards most appropriate for the current frame's
filter.  If the filter is not recognised, WAVEBAND returns " ".

=item WAVELENGTH = REAL (Returned)

The central wavelength of the waveband returned by the WAVEBAND
argument, in microns. If the filter is not recognised, WAVELENGTH
returns 0.0.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UKIRT near-infrared photometry.

=item *

The filter name comes from the user header ORAC_FILTER.

=item *

The recognised filters have names beginning J, H, K, L, L', M, I, Z, and
Y.

=item *

The mean extinction coefficients are: I<I>: 0.07, I<Z>: 0.03, I<Y>:
0.06; I<J>: 0.08; I<H>: 0.03; I<K>: 0.07; I<L>: 0.10; I<L'>:0.09, and
I<M>: 0.30.  Zero extinction applies to any other filter.
