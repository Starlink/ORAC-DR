# Name:
#    _AVERAGE_DARKS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Averages the current frame into the current dark.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive averages or copies the current frame into the
#    current dark frame.  Copying occurs if the dark is new.  Both
#    steps reported.
#
# Notes:
#    -  Only applies to dark frames as specified by user header
#    ORAC_OBSERVATION_TYPE.
#    -  The dark frame is a copy of the supplied frame, if it is the
#    first (and probably only) contributing frae.  Otherwise the
#    new frame is averaged into the dark using (dark(n-1)+frame)/n,
#    where n is the number of contributing frames.
#    -  The number of contributing frames comes from a hash stored
#    in user header DARK_FRAMES with keys equal to the dark name
#    given by primitive _GET_DARK_NAME_.

# Output Data:
#    Frame dark_<exposure_time>_<group_number>.

=head1 NAME

_AVERAGE_DARKS_ -- Averages the current frame into the current dark.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive averages or copies the current frame into the
current dark frame.  Copying occurs if the dark is new.  Both
steps reported.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

Only applies to dark frames as specified by user header
ORAC_OBSERVATION_TYPE.

=item *

The dark frame is a copy of the supplied frame, if it is the
first (and probably only) contributing frae.  Otherwise the
new frame is averaged into the dark using (dark(I<n>-1)+frame)/I<n>,
where I<n> is the number of contributing frames.

=item *

The number of contributing frames comes from a hash stored
in user header DARK_FRAMES with keys equal to the dark name
given by primitive L<_GET_DARK_NAME_|_GET_DARK_NAME_>.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

Frame dark_E<lt>exposure_timeE<gt>_E<lt>group_numberE<gt>.

=head1 TASKS

KAPPA: MATHS, NDFCOPY.
