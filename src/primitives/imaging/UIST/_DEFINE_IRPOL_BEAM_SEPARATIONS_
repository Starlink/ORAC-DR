# Name:
#    _DEFINE_IRPOL_BEAM_SEPARATIONS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Defines the separations of the e-o beams on the chip for IRPOL
#    imaging with UIST.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Specifies the default fixed e-o beam separations in an IRPOL image
#    when used with UIST.  The values are selected by filter.  Using
#    the measured offsets for bands J, H, K, and 2.122.
#
# Arguments:
#    DECOFF = REAL (Returned)
#       The separation of the e-beam and o-beam in Declination in
#       arcseconds.  The sense is e-beam minus the o-beam position on
#       the chip.
#    RAOFF = REAL (Returned)
#       The separation of the e-beam and o-beam in Right Ascension
#       measured in arcseconds.  The sense is e-beam minus the o-beam
#       position on the chip.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for UIST.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
#    -  Default values are used for any other filter name.

=head1 NAME

_DEFINE_IRPOL_BEAM_SEPARATIONS_ -- Define the separations of the e-o beams on the chip for IRPOL imaging with UIST.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the default fixed e-o beam separations in an IRPOL image
when used with UIST.  The values are selected by filter.  Using
the measured offsets for bands J, H, K, and 2.122.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item DECOFF = REAL (Returned)

The separation of the e-beam and o-beam in Declination in
arcseconds.  The sense is e-beam minus the o-beam position on
the chip.

=item RAOFF = REAL (Returned)

The separation of the e-beam and o-beam in Right Ascension
measured in arcseconds.  The sense is e-beam minus the o-beam
position on the chip.
