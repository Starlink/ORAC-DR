# Name:
#    _GENERATE_OFFSETS_JITTER_POL_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the offsets between the jittered frames in a POL recipe.
#
# Description:
#    This primitive finds the pixel offsets between the jittered target
#    frames in the current $Grp of a POL recipe.  The primitive itself
#    forms a subgroup for the current cycle and waveplate angle of
#    each of the e- and o-beam groups.  These groups are specified by
#    references stored in the internal group headers EBEAM_GROUP and
#    OBEAM_GROUP.   The primitive then passes the subgroup to other 
#    primitives to do the bulk of the work.  When argument TELEOFF is 
#    true, _TELE_OFFSETS_ is invoked and the derived offsets are used to
#    register with a shift of origin; otherwise _GENERATE_OFFSETS_ is
#    the work horse.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Arguments:
#    COMPLETE = REAL (Given)
#       Completeness of matched features for registration between two 
#       frames to be accepted.  It must be in the range 0.2 to 1.0. [0.4]
#    MINPIX = INTEGER (Given)
#       Minimum number of contiguous pixels above the PERCENTILE level
#       to be considered a registration feature.  It must be at least 6.
#       [9]
#    PERCENTILE = REAL (Given)
#       Percentile threshold for locating objects to register frames. 
#       It must be in the range 75 to 99.9.  [98]
#    TELEOFF = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), it will just use the telescope offsets to register.
#       If false (0), it will attempt automatic registration.  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for infrared imaging polarimeters.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when 
#    steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is true.
#    -  The _GENERATE_OFFSETS_ argument CENTRAL_SOURCE is TRUE.
#    Thus matching the centroids of a central source is attempted if
#    automatic registration fails.  The POLARIMETRY flag is 1.
#    -  The frames registered using telescope offsets are reported.
#    -  If the coronographic mask is used, telescope offsets are
#    used regardless of the value of the TELEOFF argument.

# Tasks:
#    CCDPACK: REGISTER; KAPPA: WCSFRAME.

GENERATE_OFFSETS_JITTER_POL -- Finds the offsets between the jittered frames in a POL recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive finds the pixel offsets between the jittered target
frames in the current $Grp of a POL recipe.  The primitive itself
forms a subgroup for the current cycle and waveplate angle of
each of the e- and o-beam groups.  These groups are specified by
references stored in the internal group headers EBEAM_GROUP and
OBEAM_GROUP.   The primitive then passes the subgroup to other 
primitives to do the bulk of the work.  When argument TELEOFF is 
true, L<_TELE_OFFSETS_> is invoked and the derived offsets are used to
register with a shift of origin; otherwise L<_GENERATE_OFFSETS_> is
the work horse.
