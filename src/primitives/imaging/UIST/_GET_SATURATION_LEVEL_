# Name:
#    _GET_SATURATION_LEVEL_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the UIST saturation level in ADU the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the UIST saturation level in ADU for the current
#    frame.
#
#    The saturation level is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    SATURATION = REAL (Returned)
#       The saturation level obtained.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for UIST.
#    -  It merely uses a constant.
#    -  The value is a guess until data are available.
