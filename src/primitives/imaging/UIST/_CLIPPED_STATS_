# Name:
#    _CLIPPED_STATS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the clipped mean and standard deviation of a frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Use progressive sigma-clipping to find a representative mean and
#    standard deviation of a frame.  The default clipping thresholds
#    give a reasonable approximation to the mode.
#
#    This variant is needed because vignetting in the UIST data can lead
#    to extreme values which despite multiple clips still biases the
#    standard deviation.  It uses the central 90% (linear) of the frame
#    to avoid the aberrant pixels if the axis length is 512 or 1024,
#    i.e. is not a mosaic.
#
# Arguments:
#    CLIP = CHARACTER (Read)
#       The clipping limits as a comma-separated list. ["2,3,3"]
#    MEAN = REAL (Write)
#       The calculated clipped mean.
#    SIGMA = REAL (Write)
#       The calculated clipped standard deviation.
#    NUMBER = INTEGER (Write)
#       The number of good pixels used to derive the statistics.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for the UIST instrument.
#    -  Only operates on OBJECT, SKY, DARK, and FLAT frames.
#
# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: NDFTRACE, STATS.

=head1 NAME

_CLIPPED_STATS_ -- Finds the clipped mean and standard deviation of a frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use progressive sigma-clipping to find a representative mean and
standard deviation of a frame.  The default clipping thresholds
give a reasonable approximation to the mode.

This variant is needed because vignetting in the UIST data can lead
to extreme values which despite multiple clips still biases the
standard deviation.  It uses the central 90% (linear) of the frame
to avoid the aberrant pixels if the axis length is 512 or 1024,
I<i.e.> is not a mosaic.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=item MEAN = REAL (Write)

The calculated clipped mean.

=item SIGMA = REAL (Write)

The calculated clipped standard deviation.

=item NUMBER = INTEGER (Write)

The number of good pixels used to derive the statistics.
