# Name:
#    _GET_GAIN_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the INGRID gain in electrons per ADU for the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the gain in electrons per ADU for the current
#    frame.  It first attempts to find a value from the ORAC_GAIN header.
#    If this is null or less than 3.0, the primitive uses a
#    time-dependent default value, and it reports the use of the default.
#
#    The gain is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    GAIN = REAL (Returned)
#       The gain obtained.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for INGRID.
#    -  The default depends on the UT date (from user header ORAC_UTDATE):
#       2000 May 1 to 2001 Feb 28: 5.8 e/ADU
#       2001 Mar 1 to 2001 Aug 31: 5.3 e/ADU
#       other dates              : 4.1 e/ADU

=head1 NAME

_GET_GAIN_ -- Finds the INGRID gain in electrons per ADU for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the gain in electrons per ADU for the current
frame.  It first attempts to find a value from the ORAC_GAIN header.
If this is null or less than 3.0, the primitive uses a
time-dependent default value, and it reports the use of the default.

The gain is returned through an argument.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item GAIN = REAL (Returned)

The gain obtained.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is only suitable for INGRID.

=item *

The default depends on the UT date (from user header ORAC_UTDATE):
    2000 May 1 to 2001 Feb 28: 5.8 e/ADU
    2001 Mar 1 to 2001 Aug 31: 5.3 e/ADU
    other dates              : 4.1 e/ADU
