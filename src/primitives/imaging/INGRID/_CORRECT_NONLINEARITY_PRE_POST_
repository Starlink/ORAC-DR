# Name:
#    _CORRECT_NONLINEARITY_PRE_POST_
#
# Purpose:
#    Corrects the post-pre differenced raw data for detector non-linearity.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive corrects the raw data frame for non-linearity
#    applying a low-order polynomial fit based upon the graph on the
#    instrument web site.  The correction is applied to the differenced
#    post minus pre frames.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for INGRID.
#    -  The measured to actual counts is given by the expression
#    1.0 - 1.2247E-06 * M - 7.68045E-11 * M * M, where M is the
#    measured ADU counts.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Linearity-corrected frame inheriting the current frame's name
#    but with the _nl suffix.
#
# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: MATHS.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

Linearity-corrected frame inheriting the current frame's name
but with the _nl suffix.

=item *

The measured to actual counts is given by the expression
1.0 - 1.2247E-06 * I<M> - 7.68045E-11 * I<M> * I<M>, where I<M> is the
measured ADU counts.
