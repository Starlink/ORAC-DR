=head1 NAME

_APHOT_MAG_ -- Performs aperture photometry for a JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR
recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive computes photometry for the individual frames and
mosaic of a jitter for the sub-group matching the current frame's
filter and cycle number.  It is a wrapper, which currently invokes
primitive L<_APHOT_MAG_|_APHOT_MAG_>
to derive aperture photometry
for a centrally located point source in the current group's mosaic
frame.  Photometry is also performed for each frame of the
sub-group, allowing for the jittered location of the point source.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item APERTURE = REAL (Given)

The aperture in arcseconds for the photometry.  [6.0]

=item INNER = REAL (Given)

The ratio of the diameters of inner ring of the sky annulus to
that of the object aperture (APERTURE).  It is constrained
to be in the range 1.1 to 3.0.  The mode of the pixel values in
the annulus is used to subtract the sky for statistics 3) and
4) listed above.  [1.2]

=item SKY_EST = INTEGER (Given)

Sky estimations method as per AUTOPHOTOM parameter SKYEST.  The
default is the mode, so as to exclude contaminating sources.
1 is the mean; 2 is the average of values within two standard
deviations of the mean; 3 is the mode from PHOTOM, 4 is a
multiply clipped mean emulating the mode but without involving
the median.  It is supplied as a constant to AUTOPHOTOM (hence
option 4).  The final option is to cope with self-flat frames
with a spike artifact in the histogram thus giving the wrong
median, and hence biased mode.   The default is used should
the supplied value not be one of the allowed options. [3]

=item OUTER = REAL (Given)

The ratio of the diameters of outer ring of the sky annulus to
that of the object aperture (APERTURE).  It is constrained to
be in the range 1.4 to 5.0 and be at least 0.3 greater than the
inner scale factor of the annulus.  [2.0]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, UIST, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs when it is time to perform photometry,
i.e. when the steering header DO_APHOT is true, and only on object
frames.

=item *

The group steering header E<lt>filterE<gt>_GROUP is used to access
the sub-group for the current frame's filter.

=item *

The updated headers are propagated back into the current filter group
from the sub-group.
