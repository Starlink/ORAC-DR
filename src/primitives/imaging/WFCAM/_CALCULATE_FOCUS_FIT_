_TEMP_2_ONEBYONE_ -- 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

Makes fwhm measurements from a series of four focus frames and after the
fourth one produces a .focus file which it then fits to get best focus.

=item *

Basically this combines the SCUBA2 fitpoly method with measurements taken
in the way of the original WFCAM focus sequence. The two are linked by a
temporary file (.focus file), named after the group.
