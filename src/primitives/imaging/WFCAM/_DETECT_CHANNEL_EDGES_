=head1 NAME

_DETECT_CHANNEL_EDGES_ - Detect when WFCAM's channel edges have been
'enhanced' by an electronics bug.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Occasionally the channel edges on WFCAM's chips go wonky, such that a
bright channel appears. This primitive looks at pixel 1025,1025 (which
is on a channel edge) and compares its value with that at pixel
1030,1030 (which is not on a channel edge). If the ratio of the two is
greater than a given threshold, then the channel edges are considered
to be 'enhanced'.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item ENHANCED = BOOLEAN (Returned)

If the channel edges are 'enhanced', then this value will be set to
true (1). Otherwise, this value will be set to false (0).

=item THRESHOLD = REAL (Given)

If the absolute value of the ratio of the 1025,1025 to 1030,1030 pixel
values is greater than this threshold, then the channel edges are
considered to be 'enhanced'. [5.0]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for WFCAM.

=item *

This primitive is probably only suitable for dark frames, as
performing this operation on a science frame where a star could appear
at pixel 1030,1030 could throw off results.
