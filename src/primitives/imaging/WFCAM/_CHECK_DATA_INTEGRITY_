=head1 NAME

_CHECK_DATA_INTEGRITY_ -- Check headers and data values to ensure
arrays are enabled, DHS is working properly, etc.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive examines the raw data to ensure that upstream software is working correctly. It currently checks that:

=over 4

=item * the array was enabled when data were taken. If an array was
disabled, then all pixels will be zero.

=back

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

None.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item * This primitive is suitable for WFCAM.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

None.

=back

=head1 TASKS

KAPPA: STATS.

=head1 REQUIRED PERL MODULES

None.
