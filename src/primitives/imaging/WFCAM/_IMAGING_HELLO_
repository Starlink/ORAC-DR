# Description:

#    vary in detail for each instrument, thus there are default or

#
#    The steps are as follows.
#    - Permits display of the raw data. 
#    - Puts the raw data into a form ready for the pipeline processing,
#    in particular it copies the data to ORAC_DATA_OUT, corrects the
#    waveplate-angle header, removes NDF axes and a blank or null title,
#    and sets the origin to allow for sub-arrays.  The copy stage may
#    include header merging for multi-integration observations.  The
#    raw data may be validated for saturated or empty wells.
#    - Determines and records the referencreoffset calibration, i.e.
#    the difference between the frame centre and the reference pixel.
#    - Switches on history recording.
#    - Corrects for electronic/electrical ghosting.
#    - Corrects for instrument non-linearity.

_IMAGING_HELLO_ -- Performs global data-reduction tasks an imaging instrument.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive does the preparatory work for recipes used by a
UKIRT imaging instrument invoking several primitives to do the
work.  Not all the steps are applicable to all instruments, or
vary in detail for each instrument, thus there are default or
or instrument-specific primitives, some of which may be dummies.

The steps are as follows.

Permits display of the raw data.

Puts the raw data into a form ready for the pipeline processing,
in particular it copies the data to ORAC_DATA_OUT, corrects the
waveplate-angle header, removes NDF axes and a blank or null title,
and sets the origin to allow for sub-arrays.  The copy stage may
include header merging for multi-integration observations.  The
raw data may be validated for saturated or empty wells.

Determines and records the referenceoffset calibration, i.e. the difference
between the frame centre and the reference pixel.
