=head1 NAME

_MASK_BAD_PIXELS_ -- Applies a bad-pixel mask.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive applies the bad-pixel mask to the current frame, 
creating a masked frame by adding a pixel mask frame.  The bad
pixels are specified by Starlink bad (`magic') values.  The 
primitive reports a successful masking and the frames concerned.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, INGRID, and
Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and
sub-frames therein.

=item *

The masked image can be displayed.

=item *

The mask frame is obtained from the $Cal-E<gt>mask method.

=item *

The frame title is propagated.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=item *

Bad-pixel-masked frame inheriting the current frame's name but with
the _bp suffix.
