=head1 NAME

_CALCULATE_FOCUS_SKY_ - Calculate focus adjustment numbers for WFCAM,
incorporating sky-subtraction.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes a WFCAM focus observation consisting of four
observations taken at two different focus positions, subtracts a
pre-determined sky frame from them, examines th FWHM of objects in
each of the four sky-subtracted observations, and calculates a
suggested change in focus.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

None.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for WFCAM.

=item *

This primitive runs when the current Frame objects's CALCULATE_FOCUS
internal uhdr is set to true.

=item *

This primitive uses a sky field stored in the current Group object's
FOCUS_SKY internal uhdr. If this is undefined, and error will be
thrown.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The sky-subtracted focus observation with _ss suffix.
