=head1 NAME

_JITTER_TIDY_ - Remove unwanted intermediate files for the JITTER recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive removes intermediate frames, but retains those with the
_ff suffix. Files are removed when they are no longer needed, as guided
by the steering headers MAKE_MOSAIC and CYCLE_NUMBER. Registration text
files with extensions .find, .off, and .res are also removed.
