=head1 NAME

_FLAT_FIELD_MASKED_GROUP_ -- Self-flat fields a group of frames.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive creates and applies self-flat field(s) for the current
group of frames.  For each observation filter present within the
group it makes a flat from the group and then divides the group
members by that flat field.  There is also optional object masking
to make an improved flat; objects in the flattened frames are detected
above brightness and size thresholds, and the frames combined to make
a new flat field.  The improved flat is then applied to the original
input group.  Four other primitives do most of the work.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for imaging infrared cameras.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object, sky, or lamp frames, and when the
steering header MAKE_FLAT is true, and only for frames in the current
recipe cycle, as given by steering header CYCLE_NUMBER.
Also the flat must not be specified already; if it is, the
primitive merely divides the group members by that flat.

=item *

The list of filters present in the group is listed in an array
stored by reference in the group user header FILTER_LIST.  If this
is undefined, only a single flat is made for filter stored in the
current Frame's user header ORAC_FILTER.

=item *

The steering header JITTER_NUMBER defines the number of
frames in a cycle.

=item *

Frame normalisation is with respect to a reference level of the first
frame, stored in the first frame's internal header REFERENCE_LEVEL.
If this is not defined, as would be the case on the first cycle, the
mode of the reference is calculated.

=back

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item MASK = LOGICAL (Given)

Perform object masking only if it is true.

=item CLEAN = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), the frames are cleaned using a box filter to remove any
small blemishes.  Pixels deviating by more than 3 standard deviations
from its 15x15 pixel neighbourhood are rejected.  This is done
iteratively, three times.  If false (0), no cleaning is performed. [1]

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The invoked primitives
L<_MAKE_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_|_MAKE_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_>,
L<_DIVIDE_BY_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_|_DIVIDE_BY_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_>,
L<_MAKE_OBJECTS_MASK_|_MAKE_OBJECTS_MASK_>, and
L<_MASK_OBJECTS_|_MASK_OBJECTS_> do create new frames.  The bottom
line is that a flat field frame is filed and indexed, and there are
flat-fielded frames each inheriting the corresponding input frame's
name but with an _ff suffix.  Various intermediate frames are normally
removed by a tidy primitive.

=item *

A map of the original bad pixels in the flat, and a flat with
original bad pixels and objects masked, having the name of the flat
with _bpm and _fm suffices respectively.
