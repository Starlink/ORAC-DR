# Name:
#    _GENERATE_OFFSETS_SKY_AND_JITTER
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the offsets between the frames in an SKY_AND_JITTER recipe.
#
# Description:
#    This primitive finds the pixel offsets between the target in the
#    current $Grp of a SKY_AND_JITTER recipe.  The primitive itself
#    forms a new temporary group to be registered.  For the first cycle
#    of the recipe all its target frames are passed.  On subsequent
#    cycles the mosaic is inserted into the group before the target
#    frames in the current cycle, so that there is a common registration
#    and that mosaics can be added.  The primitive then passes the new
#    group to primitive _GENERATE_OFFSETS_ to do the bulk of the work.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Arguments:
#    COMPLETE = REAL (Given)
#       Completeness of matched features for registration between two
#       frames to be accepted.  It must be in the range 0.2 to 1.0. [0.4]
#    MINPIX = INTEGER (Given)
#       Minimum number of contiguous pixels above the PERCENTILE level
#       to be considered a registration feature.  It must be at least 6.
#       The default here is for UFTI and the new IRCAM.  For the
#       original IRCAM3 without the magnifier, 6 proved to be
#       satisfactory.  [9]
#    PERCENTILE = REAL (Given)
#       Percentile threshold for locating objects to register frames.
#       It must be in the range 75 to 99.9.  The default here is for
#       UFTI and the new IRCAM.  For the original IRCAM3 without the
#       magnifier, 96 proved to be satisfactory.  [98]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object frames, and when the
#    steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is true.  The selected frames
#    are those in the current cycle whose steering header
#    TARGET_OR_SKY is "target".
#    -  The _GENERATE_OFFSETS_ argument CENTRAL_SOURCE is TRUE.
#    Thus matching the centroids of a central source is attempted if
#    automatic registration fails.

=head1 NAME

_GENERATE_OFFSETS_SKY_AND_JITTER_ -- Finds the offsets between the frames in a SKY_AND_JITTER recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive finds the pixel offsets between the target in the
current $Grp of a SKY_AND_JITTER recipe.  The primitive itself forms a
new temporary group to be registered.  For the first cycle of the
recipe all its target frames are passed.  On subsequent cycles the
mosaic is inserted into the group before the target frames in the
current cycle, so that there is a common registration and that mosaics
can be added.  The primitive then passes the new group to primitive
L<_GENERATE_OFFSETS_|_GENERATE_OFFSETS_> to do the bulk of the work.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item COMPLETE = REAL (Given)

Completeness of matched features for registration between two
frames to be accepted.  It must be in the range 0.2 to 1.0. [0.4]

=item MINPIX = INTEGER (Given)

Minimum number of contiguous pixels above the PERCENTILE level
to be considered a registration feature.  It must be at least 6.
The default here is for UFTI and the new IRCAM.  For the
original IRCAM3 without the magnifier, 6 proved to be
satisfactory.  [9]

=item PERCENTILE = REAL (Given)

Percentile threshold for locating objects to register frames.
It must be in the range 75 to 99.9.  The default here is for
UFTI and the new IRCAM.  For the original IRCAM3 without the
magnifier, 96 proved to be satisfactory.  [98]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object frames, and when the
steering header MAKE_MOSAIC is true.  The selected frames
are those in the current cycle whose steering header
TARGET_OR_SKY is "target".

=item *

The _GENERATE_OFFSETS_ argument CENTRAL_SOURCE is TRUE.
Thus matching the centroids of a central source is attempted if
automatic registration fails.
