=head1 PURPOSE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=item FILENAME = CHARACTER (Returned)

The name of the converted FITS file.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

Bad pixels are replaced with 65535 as the previous default FITS NaN caused
problems for some other tools.

=item *

The C<FITS-WCS> encoding is set to C<"FITS-WCS(CD)"> to describe the rotation
and scaling as a CD matrix rather than as PC matrix with C<CDELT> values.

=item *

The C<ORIGIN> is set to 'LCOGT'.

=item *

Only the Data component is converted, along with the FITS extension of the NDF
and any NDF history records - any other NDF extensions (such as CCDPACK's) are
not converted.
