# Name:
#    _FILE_BIAS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Files a frame as the current bias.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This generic primitive files the current frame as the current bias.
#    It also adds the bias to the index of bias frames.  Both steps are
#    reported.
#
# Arguments:
#    GROUP = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), filed bias will be of the form bias_gNNN, where
#       NNN is the group number. If false (0), filed bias will be of
#       the form bias_NNN, where NNN is the observation number. [0]
#
#    FILE = CHARACTER (Given)
#       The given filename will be filed as the bias. If this string
#       is empty, the current ORAC::Frame object will be filed.
#
# Output Data:
#    If filing as an observation bias, frame bias_<n>, where n is the
#    original frame number, is a copy of the supplied frame. If filing
#    as a group bias, frame bias_g<n>, where n is the group number
#    associated with the current frame, is a copy of the supplied frame.

=head1 NAME

_FILE_BIAS_ -- Files a frame as the current bias.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This generic primitive files the current frame as the current bias.
It also adds the bias to the index of bias frames.  Both steps are
reported.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item GROUP = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), filed bias will be of the form bias_gNNN, where NNN is
the group number. If false (0), filed bias will be of the form bias_NNN,
where NNN is the observation number. [0]

=item FILE = CHARACTER (Given)

The given filename will be filed as the bias. If this string is empty,
the current ORAC::Frame object will be filed.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

If filing as an observation bias, frame bias_<n>, where n is the
original frame number, is a copy of the supplied frame. If filing
as a group bias, frame bias_g<n>, where n is the group number
associated with the current frame, is a copy of the supplied frame.
