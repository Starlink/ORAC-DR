# Name:
#    _GENERATE_OFFSETS_POL_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the offsets between the e- and o-beam mosaics in a POL recipe.
#
# Description:
#    This primitive finds the pixel offsets between the eight mosaics
#    of the e- and o-beams at the four waveplate angles in a polarimetry
#    recipe.  The mosaics are stored within a group, specified by a
#    reference stored in the internal group header MOSAIC_GROUP.  The
#    primitive itself forms a subgroup for the current cycle of the
#    recipe.   The primitive then passes the sub-group to the
#    _GENERATE_OFFSETS_ primitive to do the bulk of the work.
#    Central-source matching derives the offsets.  Telescope offsets are
#    not appropriate because both the e- and o-beam mosaics have the same
#    telescope offsets, since they were derived from common frames.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Arguments:
#    COMPLETE = REAL (Given)
#       Completeness of matched features for registration between two
#       frames to be accepted.  It must be in the range 0.2 to 1.0. [0.4]
#    MINPIX = INTEGER (Given)
#       Minimum number of contiguous pixels above the PERCENTILE level
#       to be considered a registration feature.  It must be at least 6.
#       [15]
#    PERCENTILE = REAL (Given)
#       Percentile threshold for locating objects to register frames.
#       It must be in the range 75 to 99.9.  [98]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when
#    steering header REGISTER_IMAGES is true.
#    -  The _GENERATE_OFFSETS_ argument CENTRAL_SOURCE is TRUE.
#    Thus matching the centroids of a central source is attempted if
#    automatic registration fails.  The OFFSET_TYPE argument is
#    "beam-separation".  The POLARIMETRY flag is 1.
#    -  Steering header CYCLE_NUMBER specifies the current cycle of
#    the recipe.

# Generate the offsets
# ====================

# Call the generic primitive which does most of the work.  Use central
# source as the primary method.  Use a larger box to minimise risk of not
# being to use central-source offsets.  For polarimetry the box is less
# likely to contain a secondary source, so enlarging should be safe.
#
# The e and o images at a given polarisation angle have different offsets
# yet the telescope offsets are the same.  Therefore the last-resort
# offsets come from the beam separations.  OFFSET_TYPE is only for
# information messages; the POLARIMETRY flag is needed because it tells
# the central-source detection to ignore the telescope offsets, as the
# extracted regions adjust according to the telescope offsets.  We do not
# want to add the offsets again when locating the central source.
#
# The beam separations are set when the mosaic is created.  If this doesn't
# prove satisfactory it may be possible to reset the origins of the mosaics
# to give an approximation registration.

=head1 NAME

GENERATE_OFFSETS_POL -- Finds the offsets between the e- and o-beam mosaics in a POL recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive finds the pixel offsets between the eight mosaics
of the e- and o-beams at the four waveplate angles in a polarimetry
recipe.  The mosaics are stored within a group, specified by a
reference stored in the internal group header MOSAIC_GROUP.  The
primitive itself forms a subgroup for the current cycle of the
recipe.   The primitive then passes the sub-group to the
L<_GENERATE_OFFSETS_> primitive to do the bulk of the work.
Central-source matching derives the offsets.  Telescope offsets are
not appropriate because both the e- and o-beam mosaics have the same
telescope offsets, since they were derived from common frames.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=item COMPLETE = REAL (Given)

Completeness of matched features for registration between two
frames to be accepted.  It must be in the range 0.2 to 1.0. [0.4]

=item MINPIX = INTEGER (Given)

Minimum number of contiguous pixels above the PERCENTILE level
to be considered a registration feature.  It must be at least 6.
[15]

=item PERCENTILE = REAL (Given)

Percentile threshold for locating objects to register frames.
It must be in the range 75 to 99.9.  [98]

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when
steering header REGISTER_IMAGES is true.

=item *

The _GENERATE_OFFSETS_ argument CENTRAL_SOURCE is TRUE.
Thus matching the centroids of a central source is attempted if
automatic registration fails.  The OFFSET_TYPE argument is
"beam-separation".  The POLARIMETRY flag is 1.

=item *

Steering header CYCLE_NUMBER specifies the current cycle of
the recipe.
