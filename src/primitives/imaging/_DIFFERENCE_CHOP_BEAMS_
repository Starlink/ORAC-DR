#
# Purpose:
#    Differences pairs of chopped beams.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive differences the two beams, A and B, of a chopped
#    imaging observation and forms the differences A-B.  It reports
#    a successful subtraction and the frames concerned.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for Michelle in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for chopped frames, as specified
#    by user header ORAC_DETECTOR_READ_TYPE being CHOP or NDCHOP.
#    -  The chop-differenced image can be displayed.
#    -  The subtraction assumes the same exposure time for the two
#    beams.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Chop-differenced frame inheriting the frame's name but with the
#    _dcb suffix.

# The data are stored in an HDS container file as a series of NDFs.
# For each observation n these NDFs are called .InBEAMA, .InBEAMB,
# and .In, meaning the integrations in beams A then B, and the
# difference A-B respectively.  The DR originally returned just the .In.
# However, this prevents calculation of the data errors.  Thus the DR
# $Frm-files method returns a list of the beams in order .I1BEAMA,
# .I1BEAMB, .I2BEAMA, .I2BEAMB etc.  For imaging we expect just
# the .I1 beams to be present.  This is trapped in the _IMAGING_HELLO_.

_DIFFERENCE_CHOP_BEAMS_ -- Differences pairs of chopped beams

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive differences the two beams, A and B, of a chopped
imaging observation and forms the differences A-B.  It reports
a successful subtraction and the frames concerned.

=item *

This primitive is suitable for Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for chopped frames, as specified
by user header ORAC_DETECTOR_READ_TYPE being CHOP or NDCHOP.

=item *

The chop-differenced image can be displayed.

=item *

The subtraction assumes the same exposure time for the two beams.
