# Name:
#    _CREATE_WCS_

# Purpose:
#    Corrects the headers of UFTI imaging data to create an
#    AIPS-convention World Co-ordinate System.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This primitive converts astrometric information in an UFTI frame 
#    into an AIPS-convention World Co-ordinate System.  This is achieved
#    by editing the headers in the FITS airlock.
#
#    The changes are listed below.
#    a) Put decimal degrees of RABASE in CRVAL1, and DECBASE in CRVAL2.
#    The comment includes a sexagesimal version of the co-ordinate.
#    b) Change CRPIXn to the header-defined or a supplied reference
#    pixel.
#    c) Divide CDELTn by 3600 to convert to degrees.  Make CDELT1
#    negative.
#    d) Change CTYPE1 to "RA---TAN", CTYPE2 to "DEC--TAN".
#    e) Revise the comments for the above to adhere to the UKIRT FITS
#    document, orac0016-fith, e.g. CRVAL1's comment becomes "[deg] RA 
#    (hh:mm:ss.ss) at reference point" with the sexagesimal
#    position substituted.
#    f) For polarimetry, the reference pixel (CRPIX1,CRPIX2) is adjusted
#    for the bifurcation by the Wollaston prism.
#    
#    The primitive reports the changes made to the WCS.

# Arguments:
#    XREF = REAL (Given)
#       The x pixel index corresponding to the base equatorial position.
#       This defaults to the centre of the array along the RA axis for
#       sub-arrays, but 20 pixels into the west half for the full array.
#       If supplied beyond the range 0 to 1024, or some non-numeric value
#       supplied, a warning is issued and the default adopted.  []
#    YREF = REAL (Given)
#       The y pixel index corresponding to the base equatorial position.
#       This defaults to the centre of the array along the Declination
#       axis for sub-arrays, but 25 pixels into the south half for the
#       full array.  If supplied beyond the range 0 to 1024, or some
#       non-numeric value supplied, a warning is issued and the default
#       adopted.  []

# Notes:
#    -  Editing only occurs for OBJECT and SKY frames, for which
#    there is no WCS.  This includes all editing steps.
#    -  The primitive multiplies the ORAC_RA_SCALE internal header
#    value by -1 whenever it creates an AIPS-convention WCS to give the
#    correct sense of the pixel increment.
#    -  The reference pixel position comes from internal headers
#    ORAC_X_REFERENCE_PIXEL and ORAC_Y_REFERENCE_PIXEL.  These
#    include allowance for polarimetry.
#    -  The location of the reference pixel is the biggest source
#    of error, and may vary systematically with telescope operator.
#    Comparison of real data with the defaults suggests errors
#    are typically +/-2" in each axis.
#    -  Following a successful introduction of a WCS, the current
#    AST Frame is SKY.  Any existing WCS Frames besides the default
#    three---PIXEL, GRID, AXIS---are lost. 

# Output Data:
#    The modified NDF.

# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: ERASE, FITSMOD, WCSFRAME.

_CREATE_WCS_  -- Corrects the headers of UFTI imaging data to create an AIPS-convention World Co-ordinate System.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive converts astrometric information in an UFTI frame into
an AIPS-convention World Co-ordinate System.  This is achieved by
editing the headers in the FITS airlock.

The changes are listed below.

a) Put decimal degrees of RABASE in CRVAL1, and DECBASE in CRVAL2.
The comment includes a sexagesimal version of the co-ordinate.

b) Change CRPIXI<n> to the header-defined or a supplied reference
pixel.

c) Divide CDELTI<n> by 3600 to convert to degrees.  Make CDELT1
negative.

d) Change CTYPE1 to "RA---TAN", CTYPE2 to "DEC--TAN".

e) Revise the comments for the above to adhere to the UKIRT FITS
document, orac0016-fith, e.g. CRVAL1's comment becomes "[deg] RA
(hh:mm:ss.ss) at reference point" with the sexagesimal
position substituted.

f) For polarimetry, the reference pixel (CRPIX1,CRPIX2) is adjusted
for the bifurcation by the Wollaston prism.

The primitive reports the changes made to the WCS.
