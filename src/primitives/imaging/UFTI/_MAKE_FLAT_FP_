# Name:
#    _MAKE_FLAT_FP_
#
# Purpose:
#    Makes a flat from the current of offline FP frames.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive makes a self flat from the current cycle of offline
#    FP frames in the current group.  It uses a median to combine the
#    frames pixel by pixel, and then divides the resultant image by its
#    mean form the flat field.  The primitive files the resultant flat
#    in its calibration index. 
#
# Arguments:
#    CLEAN = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), the frames are cleaned using a box filter to remove
#       any small blemishes.  Pixels deviating by more than 3 standard
#       deviations from its 15x15 pixel neighbourhood are rejected.  This
#       is done iteratively, three times.  If false (0), no cleaning is
#       performed.  [1]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when the
#    steering header MAKE_FLAT is true.
#    -  The offline frames are selected using the steering headers
#    ON_OR_OFF (set to "off"), and the CYCLE_NUMBER matching the current
#    recipe cycle.
#    -  The flat is displayed.
#
# Tasks:
#    CCDPACK: MAKEFLAT.
#
# Output Data:
#    The flat field.  It is called is "flat_<filter>_<groupnumber>" for
#    the first cycle, and "flat_<filter>_<groupnumber>_c<cyclenumber>"
#    for subsequent cycles, where <groupnumber> is the frame number of the
#    group, <filter> is the filter name, and <cyclenumber> is the cycle
#    number derived from steering header CYCLE_NUMBER.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive makes a self flat from the current cycle of offline
FP frames in the current group.  It uses a median to combine the
frames pixel by pixel, and then divides the resultant image by its
mean form the flat field.  The primitive files the resultant flat
in its calibration index. 

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item CLEAN = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), the frames are cleaned using a box filter to remove any
small blemishes.  Pixels deviating by more than 3 standard deviations
from its 15x15 pixel neighbourhood are rejected.  This is done
iteratively, three times.  If false (0), no cleaning is performed. [1]

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when the
steering header MAKE_FLAT is true.

=item *

The offline frames are selected using the steering headers
ON_OR_OFF (set to "off"), and the CYCLE_NUMBER matching the current
recipe cycle.

subsequent cycles, where E<lt>groupnumberE<gt> is the frame number of
the group, E<lt>filterE<gt> is the filter name, and
