=head1 NAME

_CHECK_SKY_COUNTS_ - Examine the sky counts and throw a warning if they're
too low.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes statistics on the current frame and throws a warning
if the clipped median is below a certain threshhold that depends on the
filter.

For the K98 filter, the threshhold is 0.8 * 30 * exposure time. For the H98
filter, the threshhold is 0.8 * 40 * exposure time. Other filters are not
checked.

=head1 ARGUMENT

=over 4

=item CLIP = STRING (Given)

The clip levels used to determine the median. This parameter
should be of the form N,N, where clip levels are integers separated
by commas. [2,2,3]

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is only suitable for UFTI.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object frames.
