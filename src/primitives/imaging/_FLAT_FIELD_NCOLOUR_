# Name:
#    _FLAT_FIELD_NCOLOUR_
#
# Purpose:
#    Self-flat fields a group of frames of the same filter for a
#    JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR recipe.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive creates and applies self-flat field for the
#    sub-group matching the current frame's filter and cycle number.
#    It is part of a JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR recipe.
#
#    It merely calls the standard _FLAT_FIELD_MASKED_GROUP_ primitive
#    using the sub-group instead of the current $Grp.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when the
#    steering header MAKE_FLAT is true.
#    -  The group steering header <filter>_GROUP is used to access
#    the sub-group for the current frame's filter.
#
# Arguments:
#    MASK = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Perform object masking only if it is true.  [1]
#
# Output Data:
#    None.  However, the invoked primitive (_FLAT_FIELD_MASKED_GROUP_)
#    and other primitives it calls (_MAKE_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_,
#    _DIVIDE_BY_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_, _MAKE_OBJECTS_MASK_, and
#    _MASK_OBJECTS_) do create new frames.  The bottom line is that
#    a flat field frame is filed and indexed, and there are
#    flat-fielded frames each inheriting the corresponding input
#    frame's name but with an _ff suffix.  Various intermediate
#    frames are normally removed by a tidy primitive.

=head1 NAME

_FLAT_FIELD_NCOLOUR_ -- Self-flat fields a group of frames of the same filter for a JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive creates and applies self-flat field for the
sub-group matching the current frame's filter and cycle number.
It is part of a JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR recipe.

It merely calls the standard _FLAT_FIELD_MASKED_GROUP_ primitive
using the sub-group instead of the current $Grp.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when the
steering header MAKE_FLAT is true.

=item *

The group steering header E<lt>filterE<gt>_GROUP is used to access
the sub-group for the current frame's filter.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item MASK = LOGICAL (Given)

Perform object masking only if it is true.  [1]

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.  However, the invoked primitive (_FLAT_FIELD_MASKED_GROUP_)
and other primitives it calls (_MAKE_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_,
_DIVIDE_BY_FLAT_FROM_GROUP_, _MAKE_OBJECTS_MASK_, and
_MASK_OBJECTS_) do create new frames.  The bottom line is that
a flat field frame is filed and indexed, and there are
flat-fielded frames each inheriting the corresponding input
frame's name but with an _ff suffix.  Various intermediate
frames are normally removed by a tidy primitive.
