# Name:
#    _MAKE_FLAT_QUADRANT_JITTER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Makes a flat from the frames of a QUADRANT_JITTER recipe.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive processes frames in the current $Grp of an
#    QUADRANT_JITTER recipe, to make a flat field.  It masks deviant
#    pixels, normalises the frames to each other using their modes,
#    masks each quadrant, and combines the frames using the median
#    at each pixel.  The resultant frame is normalised (to 1) to make
#    the flat.  The flat is indexed.
#
# Arguments:
#    REFMODE = REAL (Given)
#       The reference mode, if applicable.  If no reference mode is
#       given, then a constant level of normalization is done (i.e.
#       none).  []
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  The work is done by _MASK_DEVIANTS_, _NORMALISE_TO_MODE_,
#    _MASK_QUADRANT_, and _MAKE_FLAT_FROM_NORMALISED_GROUP_
#    primitives.
#
# Output Data:
#    None.  However, the invoked primitives do create new frames.  The
#    bottom line is that a flat field frame is filed and indexed.
#    Various intermediate frames are normally removed by a tidy primitive.

=head1 NAME

_MAKE_FLAT_QUADRANT_JITTER_ -- Makes a flat from the sky frames for an QUADRANT_JITTER recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive processes sky frames in the current $Grp of an
QUADRANT_JITTER recipe, to make a flat field.  It masks deviant pixels,
normalises the sky frames to each other, and combines the frames
using the median at each pixel.  The resultant frame is
normalised (to 1) to make the flat.  The flat is indexed.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item REFMODE = REAL (Given)

The reference mode, if applicable.  If no reference mode is given, then
a constant level of normalization is done (i.e. none).  []
