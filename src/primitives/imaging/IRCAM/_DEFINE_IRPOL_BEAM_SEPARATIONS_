# Name:
#    _DEFINE_IRPOL_BEAM_SEPARATIONS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Defines the separations of the e-o beams on the chip for IRPOL imaging
#    with IRCAM.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Specifies the default fixed e-o beam separations in an IRPOL image
#    when used with IRCAM.  The values are selected by filter.
#    Measured values are available for J, H, K, Ice, Dust, 3.5nbL, L,
#    L', 4.0c, and BrA.
#
# Arguments:
#    DECOFF = REAL (Returned)
#       The separation of the e-beam and o-beam in Declination in
#       arcseconds.  The sense is e-beam minus the o-beam position on
#       the chip.
#    RAOFF = REAL (Returned)
#       The separation of the e-beam and o-beam in Right Ascension
#       measured in arcseconds.  The sense is e-beam minus the o-beam
#       position on the chip.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for IRCAM.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.
#    -  Default values are used for any other filter name.
