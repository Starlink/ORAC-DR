# Name:
#    _CREATE_WCS_

# Purpose:
#    Corrects the headers of IRCAM imaging data to create an
#    AIPS-convention World Co-ordinate System.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This primitive converts astrometric information in an IRCAM
#    frame into an AIPS-convention World Co-ordinate System.
#    This is achieved by editing the headers in the FITS airlock.
#
#    The changes are listed below.
#    a) Put decimal degrees of RABASE in CRVAL1, and DECBASE in CRVAL2.
#    The comment includes a sexagesimal version of the co-ordinate.
#    b) Change CRPIXn to the header-defined or a supplied reference
#    pixel.
#    c) Divide CDELTn by 3600 to convert to degrees.  Make CDELT1
#    negative.
#    d) Change CTYPE1 to "RA---TAN", CTYPE2 to "DEC--TAN".
#    e) Revise the comments for the above to adhere to the UKIRT FITS
#    document, orac0016-fith, e.g. CRVAL1's comment becomes "[deg] RA
#    (hh:mm:ss.ss) at reference point" with the sexagesimal
#    position substituted.
#
#    Old IRCAM headers are also shuffled, reformatted, with new
#    comments to bring them into closer agreement with the UKIRT
#    FITS standard promulgated in orac-0016-fith.  This uses the
#    $ORAC_DATA_CAL/fits_reorder.lis steering file.
#
# Arguments:
#    XREF = REAL (Given)
#       The x pixel index corresponding to the base equatorial position.
#       This defaults to the centre of the array along the RA axis.
#       If supplied beyond the range 0 to 256, or some non-numeric value
#       supplied, a warning is issued and the default adopted.  []
#    YREF = REAL (Given)
#       The y pixel index corresponding to the base equatorial position.
#       This defaults to the centre of the array along the Declination
#       axis.  If supplied beyond the range 0 to 256, or some
#       non-numeric value supplied, a warning is issued and the default
#       adopted.  []

# Notes:
#    -  Editing only occurs for OBJECT and SKY frames, for which
#    there is no WCS.  This includes all editing steps.
#    -  The primitive multiplies the ORAC_RA_SCALE internal header
#    value by -1 whenever it creates an AIPS-convention WCS to give the
#    correct sense of the pixel increment.
#    -  The reference pixel position comes from internal headers
#    ORAC_X_REFERENCE_PIXEL and ORAC_Y_REFERENCE_PIXEL.  These
#    do not include provision for polarimetry.
#    -  The location of the reference pixel is the biggest source
#    of error, and may vary systematically with telescope operator.
#    Comparison of real data with the defaults suggests errors
#    are typically +/-2" in each axis.
#    -  Following a successful introduction of a WCS, the current
#    AST Frame is SKY.  Any existing WCS Frames besides the default
#    three---PIXEL, GRID, AXIS---are lost.
#    -  Problem instrument names containing the Xi string
#    (during polarimetry and FP observations) are corrected.

# Output Data:
#    The modified NDF.

# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: ERASE, FITSMOD, WCSFRAME.

=head1 NAME

_CREATE_WCS_  -- Corrects the headers of IRCAM imaging data to create an AIPS-convention World Co-ordinate System.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive converts astrometric information in an IRCAM
frame into an AIPS-convention World Co-ordinate System.
This is achieved by editing the headers in the FITS airlock.

The changes are listed below.

a) Put decimal degrees of RABASE in CRVAL1, and DECBASE in CRVAL2.
The comment includes a sexagesimal version of the co-ordinate.

b) Change CRPIXI<n> to the header-defined or a supplied reference
pixel.

c) Divide CDELTI<n> by 3600 to convert to degrees.  Make CDELT1
negative.

d) Change CTYPE1 to "RA---TAN", CTYPE2 to "DEC--TAN".

e) Revise the comments for the above to adhere to the UKIRT FITS
document, orac0016-fith, e.g. CRVAL1's comment becomes "[deg] RA
(hh:mm:ss.ss) at reference point" with the sexagesimal
position substituted.

Old IRCAM headers are also shuffled, reformatted, with new
comments to bring them into closer agreement with the UKIRT
FITS standard promulgated in orac-0016-fith.  This uses the
F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/fits_reorder.lis> steering file.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item XREF = REAL (Given)

The I<x> pixel index corresponding to the base equatorial position.
This defaults to the centre of the array. If supplied beyond the range
0 to 256, or some non-numeric value supplied, a warning is issued and
the default adopted.  []

=item YREF = REAL (Given)

The I<y> pixel index corresponding to the base equatorial position.
This defaults to the centre of the array. If supplied beyond the range
0 to 256, or some non-numeric value supplied, a warning is issued and
