# Name:
#    _DEFINE_POL_REGIONS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Determine the extents of object and sky regions of an IRCAM
#    polarimetry frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    A polarimetry frame is divided into four sections: object and sky
#    for the e- and o-beams.  This primitive returns the extents of these
#    regions for subsequent extraction and sky subtraction.  The frames
#    are deemed to be aligned approximately with Right Ascension and
#    Declination and the jittering is along the Right-ascension axis.
#    Also the order of the regions from north to south is e target,
#    o target, e sky, and o sky.
#
#    At present fixed limits are used, but sigma-clipped profiling is
#    possible to determine where each region starts and ends along the
#    Declination axis.
#
#    The current target limits are 30% to 70% of the frame width about
#    the jittered Right-ascension centre using the telescope offsets, or
#    10% to 90% if argument EXTENDED is true.  Thus the limits define a
#    section 40% or 80% of the Right-ascension width of the frame
#    roughly centred on the source.  The restriction is to make mosaics
#    with few pixels not derived from all contributing jittered frames,
#    since there are usually only three jitter positions, and to allow
#    a reasonable jitter step.  If the jitter size was restricted, the
#    limits could be expanded for extended sources.
#
#    The current sky limits are 1% to 99% of the frame width along the
#    Right-ascension axis.
#
# Arguments:
#    ESBOUNDS( 4 ) = INTEGER (Returned)
#       The pixel bounds defining the e-beam sky region in a raw
#       polarisation frame.
#    ETBOUNDS( 4 ) = INTEGER (Returned)
#       The pixel bounds defining the e-beam target region in a raw
#       polarisation frame.
#    EXTENDED = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), wider Right Ascension limits are used for the
#       target regions, 10% to 90%, instead of 30% to 70%. [0]
#    OSBOUNDS( 4 ) = INTEGER (Returned)
#       The pixel bounds defining the o-beam sky region in a raw
#       polarisation frame.
#    OTBOUNDS( 4 ) = INTEGER (Returned)
#       The pixel bounds defining the o-beam target region in a raw
#       polarisation frame.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for IRCAM.
#    -  It only operates on object frames.
#    -  Fractional pixel limits are rounded to the next lower integer.
#    -  The Declination pixel limits for the sections are as follows.
#    o sky: 12--52; e sky: 67--107; o target: 152--192; e target:
#    207--247.
#    -  Allowance is made if the chip is rotated such that the
#    Declination axis increases or decreases with x.

_DEFINE_POL_REGIONS_ -- Determine the extents of object and sky regions of an IRCAM polarimetry frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A polarimetry frame is divided into four sections: object and sky
for the e- and o-beams.  This primitive returns the extents of these
regions for subsequent extraction and sky subtraction.  The frames
are deemed to be aligned approximately with Right Ascension and
Declination and the jittering is along the Right-ascension axis.
Also the order of the regions from north to south is e target,
o target, e sky, and o sky.

At present fixed limits are used, but sigma-clipped profiling is
possible to determine where each region starts and ends along the
Declination axis.

The current target limits are 30% to 70% of the frame width about
the jittered Right-ascension centre using the telescope offsets.
Thus the limits define a section 40% of the Right-ascension width
of the frame roughly centred on the source.  The restriction is to
make mosaics with few pixels not derived from all contributing
jittered frames, since there are usually only three jitter positions,
and to allow a reasonable jitter step.  If the jitter size was
restricted, the limits could be expanded for extended sources.

The current sky limits are 1% to 99% of the frame width along the
Right-ascension axis.
