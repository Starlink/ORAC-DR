# Name:
#    _CORRECT_NONLINEARITY_
#
# Purpose:
#    Corrects the raw data for detector non-linearity.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive corrects the raw data frame for non-linearity
#    applying the low-order polynomial fit on the instrument web page.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for IRCAM.
#    -  The correction is only applied when the detector bias voltage,
#    as given by user header ORAC_DETECTOR_BIAS, is between 0.61 and
#    0.63, in STARE or ND_STARE modes.  The mode comes from user header
#    ORAC_DETECTOR_READ_TYPE.
#    -  In STARE mode an approximate bias of 24460 is subtracted before
#    applying the polynomial.  This serves adequately; even at high
#    fluxes this should at worst give a 0.5% error, and in most
#    circumstances will be much less.
#    -  The LINEAR header value is modified to T.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Linearity-corrected frame inheriting the current frame's name
#    but with the _nl suffix.
#
# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: FITSMOD, MATHS.

This primitive corrects the raw data frame for non-linearity

This primitive is suitable for IRCAM.

The correction is only applied when the detector bias voltage,
as given by user header ORAC_DETECTOR_BIAS, is between 0.61 and
0.63, in STARE or ND_STARE modes.  The mode comes from user header
ORAC_DETECTOR_READ_TYPE.

=item *

In STARE mode an approximate bias of 24460 is subtracted before
applying the polynomial.  This serves adequately; even at high
fluxes this should at worst give a 0.5% error, and in most
circumstances will be much less.

=item *

The LINEAR header value is modified to T.
