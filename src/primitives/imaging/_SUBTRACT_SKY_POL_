# Name:
#    _SUBTRACT_SKY_POL_
#
# Purpose:
#    Creates sky-subtracted e- and o-beam images for polarimetry recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive creates sky-subtracted e- and o-beam images.  The
#    images are subsets of the current frame in the appropriate region.
#    Modal sky values are determined from e- and o-beam sky areas within
#    the frame.  The sky-subtracted e- and o-beam frames are stored in two
#    groups, which are created if they do not already exist.  References
#    to the groups are stored in the main $Grp user headers called
#    EBEAM_GROUP and OBEAM_GROUP.
#
#    The primitive reports a successful sky subtraction and the frames
#    concerned.  It is a variant of _SUBTRACT_SKY_ for POL recipes.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object frames.
#    -  If the supplied target frame contains a variance array,
#    the error in the sky level is incorporated into the 
#    sky-subtracted frame's variance.
#    -  The sky-subtracted images can be displayed.
#    -  The frame title is propagated.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Sky-subtracted e-beam and o-beam frames inheriting the frame's
#    name but with the _ess and _oss suffices respectively.

=head1 NAME

SUBTRACT_SKY_POL -- Creates sky-subtracted e- and o-beam images for polarimetry recipes.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive creates sky-subtracted e- and o-beam images.  The
images are subsets of the current frame in the appropriate region.
Modal sky values are determined from e- and o-beam sky areas within
the frame.  The sky-subtracted e- and o-beam frames are stored in two
groups, which are created if they do not already exist.  References
to the groups are stored in the main $Grp user headers called
EBEAM_GROUP and OBEAM_GROUP.

The primitive reports a successful sky subtraction and the frames
concerned.  It is a variant of L<_SUBTRACT_SKY_|_SUBTRACT_SKY_> for
POL recipes.

=head1 NOTES

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object frames.

=item *

If the supplied target frame contains a variance array,
the error in the sky level is incorporated into the 
sky-subtracted frame's variance.

=item *

The sky-subtracted images can be displayed.

=item *

The frame title is propagated.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

Sky-subtracted e-beam and o-beam frames inheriting the frame's
name but with the _ess and _oss suffices respectively.
