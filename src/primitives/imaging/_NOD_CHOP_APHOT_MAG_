# Name:
#    _NOD_CHOP_APHOT_MAG_
#
# Purpose:
#    Performs aperture photometry for NOD_CHOP recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive computes photometry for a NOD_CHOP mosaic by
#    combining the four individual images into one, partioning the
#    mosaic symmetrically.  It centroids about the nominal positions of
#    the two positive and two negative images before co-adding.  It
#    invokes _FIXED_APERTURE_MIDIR_PHOTOMETRY_ to derive aperture
#    photometry for this combined source.
#
# Arguments:
#    APERTURE = REAL (Given)
#       The aperture in arcseconds for the photometry.  [3.0]
#    INNER = REAL (Given)
#       The ratio of the diameters of inner ring of the sky annulus to
#       that of the object aperture (APERTURE).  It is constrained
#       to be in the range 1.1 to 3.0.  The mode of the pixel values in
#       the annulus is used to subtract the sky for statistics 3) and
#       4) listed above.  [2.0]
#    SKY_EST = INTEGER (Given)
#       Sky estimations method as per AUTOPHOTOM parameter SKYEST.  The
#       default is the mode, so as to exclude contaminating sources.
#       1 is the mean; 2 is the average of values within two standard
#       deviations of the mean; 3 is the mode from PHOTOM, 4 is a
#       multiply clipped mean emulating the mode but without involving
#       the median.  It is supplied as a constant to AUTOPHOTOM (hence
#       option 4).  The final option is to cope with self-flat frames
#       with a spike artifact in the histogram thus giving the wrong
#       median, and hence biased mode.  The default is used should
#       the supplied value not be one of the allowed options. [4]
#    OUTER = REAL (Given)
#       The ratio of the diameters of outer ring of the sky annulus to
#       that of the object aperture (APERTURE).  It is constrained to
#       be in the range 1.4 to 5.0 and be at least 0.3 greater than the
#       inner scale factor of the annulus.  [3.0]
#    ZP = REAL (Given)
#       Zero point to apply to instrumental magnitudes before
#       conversion to Janskys.  [12.0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for Michelle in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs when it is time to perform photometry,
#    i.e. when the steering header DO_APHOT is true, and only on object
#    frames.
#    -  The steering header CYCLE_NUMBER specifies the recipe cycle
#    number, which is used as the suffix passed to the photometry
#    routine.
#    -  Invokes L<_COMBINE_CHOPPED_SOURCE_|_COMBINE_CHOPPED_SOURCE_> to
#    produce the combined image and some neighbouring background.

#  type recipes only provide a small area around each star image.  This
#  default should include most if not all pixels beyond the inner radius.
