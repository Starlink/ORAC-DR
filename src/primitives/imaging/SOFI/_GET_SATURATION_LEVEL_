# Name:
#    _GET_SATURATION_LEVEL_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the SOFI saturation level in ADU the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the SOFI saturation level in ADU for the current
#    frame.
#
#    The saturation level is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    SATURATION = REAL (Returned)
#       The saturation level obtained.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for SOFI.
#    -  It uses documented well capacities for each camera, divided by the gain.
#    The camera comes from header HIERARCH.ESO.DET.MODE.NAME.
