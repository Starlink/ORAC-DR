#
# Purpose:
#    Makes a flat from the sky frames for an EXTENDED recipe.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive processes sky frames in the current $Grp of an
#    EXTENDED recipe, to make a flat field.  It masks deviant pixels,
#    normalises the sky frames to each other, and combines the frames
#    using the median at each pixel.  The resultant frame is
#    normalised (to 1) to make the flat.  The flat is indexed.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for near infra-red imagers.
#    -  Processing only occurs when the steering header TARGET_OR_SKY
#    is "sky".
#    -  The work is done by _MASK_DEVIANTS_, _NORMALISE_TO_MODE_EXTENDED_,
#    and _MAKE_FLAT_FROM_NORMALISED_EXTENDED_ primitives.
#    -  Stores the template name before normalisation, so that it can
#    be reset at the end, for determining sky levels.
#
# Output Data:
#    None.  However, the invoked primitives do create new frames.  The
#    bottom line is that a flat field frame is filed and indexed.
#    Various intermediate frames are normally removed by a tidy primitive.

_MAKE_FLAT_EXTENDED_ -- Makes a flat from the sky frames for an EXTENDED recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive processes sky frames in the current $Grp of an
EXTENDED recipe, to make a flat field.  It masks deviant pixels,
normalises the sky frames to each other, and combines the frames
using the median at each pixel.  The resultant frame is
normalised (to 1) to make the flat.  The flat is indexed.

=head1 NOTES

=item *

This primitive is suitable for near infra-red imagers.

=item *

Processing only occurs when the steering header TARGET_OR_SKY is "sky".

=item *

The work is done by L<_MASK_DEVIANTS_|_MASK_DEVIANTS_>,
L<_NORMALISE_TO_MODE_EXTENDED_|_NORMALISE_TO_MODE_EXTENDED_>,
and L<_MAKE_FLAT_FROM_NORMALISED_EXTENDED_|_NORMALISE_TO_MODE_EXTENDED_>
primitives.

=item *

Stores the template name before normalisation, so that it can
be reset at the end, for determining sky levels.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.  However, the invoked primitives do create new frames.  The
bottom line is that a flat field frame is filed and indexed.
Various intermediate frames are normally removed by a tidy primitive.
