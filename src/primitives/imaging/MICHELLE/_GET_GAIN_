# Name:
#    _GET_GAIN_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the Michelle gain in electrons per ADU for the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the gain in electrons per ADU for the current
#    frame.  It first attempts to find a value from the ORAC_GAIN header.
#    If this is null or less than 100.0, the primitive uses a default value
#    of 500, and it reports the use of the default.
#
#    The gain is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    GAIN = REAL (Returned)
#       The gain obtained.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for Michelle.

_GET_GAIN_ -- Finds the Michelle gain in electrons per ADU for the current Frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the gain in electrons per ADU for the current
frame.  It first attempts to find a value from the ORAC_GAIN header.
If this is null or less than 100.0, the primitive uses a default value
of 500, and it reports the use of the default.

The gain is returned through an argument.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=item GAIN = REAL (Returned)

The gain obtained.
