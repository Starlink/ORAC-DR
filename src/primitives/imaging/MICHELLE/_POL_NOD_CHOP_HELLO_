# Name:
#    _POL_NOD_CHOP_HELLO_
#
# Purpose:
#    Sets up data-reduction tasks and data for POL_NOD_CHOP recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Sets up CCDPACK-related global parameters for POL_NOD_CHOP
#    recipes.  The settings are as follows.
#
#    -  The readout bounds in the internal headers ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND,
#    ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND, ORAC_X_UPPER_BOUND, ORAC_Y_UPPER_BOUND define
#    the pixel limits for processing, i.e. there are no bias strips and
#    interpolation direction.
#    -  Error processing is disabled so the readout noise and
#    analogue-to-digital conversions are not specified.
#    -  There is no deferred charge.
#    -  Position list processing tasks expect to find the names of lists
#    stored within NDFs.
#    -  Logging is to the terminal.
#    -  The data type of NDF arrays is preserved.
#    -  Does not detect saturated pixels.
#    -  Parameters are neither saved from or to a `restoration' file.
#
#    The script also performs the following tasks.
#    -  Calls the steering primitive to set steering headers.
#    -  Calls _PREPARE_SINGLE_FRAME_ primitive to create error,
#    subtract integrations for chopped data, remove the bias,
#    and create a valid world co-ordinate system.
#
# Arguments:
#    JITTER_BEFORE_ANGLE = LOGICAL (Given)
#       The selects the ordering of the frames.  If true (1), the
#       jittering occurs at all positions before the waveplate is
#       turned.  If false (0), all waveplate angles are observed at
#       a given offset.  [1]
#    NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)
#       The number of frames in the jitter.  If absent, the number of
#       offsets, as given by internal header ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS, minus
#       one is used.  If neither is available, 4 is used.  An error state
#       arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer than 4 and not a
#       multiple of 4.  []
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [1]

=head1 NAME

_POL_NOD_CHOP_HELLO_ -- Sets up data-reduction tasks and data for POL_NOD_CHOP recipes.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sets up CCDPACK-related global parameters for POL_NOD_CHOP
recipes.  The settings are as follows.

=over 4

=item *

The readout bounds in the internal headers ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND,
ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND, ORAC_X_UPPER_BOUND, ORAC_Y_UPPER_BOUND define the
pixel limits for processing, i.e. there are no bias strips and
interpolation direction.

=item *

Error processing is disabled so the readout noise and
analogue-to-digital conversions are not specified.

=item *

There is no deferred charge.

=item *

Position list processing tasks expect to find the names of lists
stored within NDFs.

=item *

Logging is to the terminal.

=item *

The data type of NDF arrays is preserved.

=item *

Does not detect saturated pixels.

=item *

Parameters are neither saved from or to a `restoration' file.

=back

The script also performs the following tasks.

=over 4

=item *

Calls the steering primitive to set steering headers.

=item *

Calls L<_PREPARE_SINGLE_FRAME|_PREPARE_SINGLE_FRAME_> primitive to
create error, subtract integrations for chopped data, remove the bias,
and create a valid world co-ordinate system.

=item JITTER_BEFORE_ANGLE = LOGICAL (Given)

The selects the ordering of the frames.  If true (1), the
jittering occurs at all positions before the waveplate is
turned.  If false (0), all waveplate angles are observed at
a given offset.  [1]

=item NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)

The number of frames in the jitter.  If absent, the number of offsets,
as given by internal header ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS, minus one is used.
If neither is available, 4 is used.  An error state arises if the
number of jittered frames is fewer than 4 and not a multiple of 4.  []

=item USEVAR = LOGICAL (Given)

Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [1]
