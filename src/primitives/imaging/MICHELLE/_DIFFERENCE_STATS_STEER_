=head1 NAME

_DIFFERENCE_STATS_STEER_ -- Steers processing for the DIFFERENCE_STATS recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive sets up steering headers to control processing for
the DIFFERENCE_STATS recipe.

=head1 STEERING HEADERS

=item CALC_AVERAGE = LOGICAL

Whether or not to calculate a group average. It is true when the final
frame in the group is reduced. The number of frames in the group is
controlled with the NUMBER parameter.

=item DIFFERENCE_PAIR = LOGICAL

Whether or not to subtract one frame from the previous frame to form
a differenced pair. True for every second frame.

=item NUMBER = INTEGER

The number of frames in the group.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)

The number of frames in the group. [20]
