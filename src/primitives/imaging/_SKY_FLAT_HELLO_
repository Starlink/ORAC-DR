# Name:
#    _SKY_FLAT_HELLO_
#
# Purpose:
#    Sets up data-reduction tasks and data for SKY_FLAT recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Sets up CCDPACK-related global parameters for SKY_FLAT
#    recipes.  The settings are as follows.
#
#    -  The readout bounds in the internal headers ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND,
#    ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND, ORAC_X_UPPER_BOUND, ORAC_Y_UPPER_BOUND define
#    the pixel limits for processing, i.e. there are no bias strips and
#    interpolation direction.
#    -  Error processing is disabled so the readout noise and
#    analogue-to-digital conversions are not specified.
#    -  There is no deferred charge.
#    -  Position list processing tasks expect to find the names of lists
#    stored within NDFs.
#    -  Logging is to the terminal.
#    -  The data type of NDF arrays is preserved.
#    -  Does not detect saturated pixels.
#    -  Parameters are neither saved from or to a `restoration' file.
#
#    The script also performs the following tasks.
#    -  Calls the steering primitive to set steering headers.
#    -  Calls _PREPARE_SINGLE_FRAME_ primitive to create data errors,
#    subtract integrations for chopped data, remove the bias,
#    and create a valid world co-ordinate system.
#
# Arguments:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)
#       The number of frames in the jitter.  If absent, the number of
#       offsets, as given by user header ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS, minus
#       one is used.  If neither is available, 5 is used.  An error state
#       arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer than 3.  []
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]
#    WAVEPLATE_FLAT  = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not to make a flat for each polarimeter waveplate
#       angle.  For non-polarimetric data, the value ofd the argument is
#       immaterial.  For polarimetric data, false (0) means combine all
#       waveplate angles to make the flat (there should be an equal
#       number of each angle).  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for imaging instruments.

_SKY_FLAT_HELLO_ -- Sets up data-reduction tasks and data for SKY_FLAT recipes.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sets up CCDPACK-related global parameters for SKY_FLAT
recipes.  The settings are as follows.

=over 4

=item *

The readout bounds in the internal headers ORAC_X_LOWER_BOUND,
ORAC_Y_LOWER_BOUND, ORAC_X_UPPER_BOUND, ORAC_Y_UPPER_BOUND define the
pixel limits for processing, i.e. there are no bias strips and
interpolation direction.

=item *

Error processing is disabled so the readout noise and
analogue-to-digital conversions are not specified.

=item *

There is no deferred charge.

=item *

Position list processing tasks expect to find the names of lists
stored within NDFs.

=item *

Logging is to the terminal.

=item *

The data type of NDF arrays is preserved.

=item *

Does not detect saturated pixels.

=item *

Parameters are neither saved from or to a `restoration' file.

=back

The script also performs the following tasks.

=over 4

=item *

Calls the steering primitive to set steering headers.

=item *

Calls L<_PREPARE_SINGLE_FRAME|_PREPARE_SINGLE_FRAME_> primitive to
create data errors, subtract integrations for chopped data, remove the bias,
and create a valid world co-ordinate system.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)

The number of frames in the jitter.  If absent, the number of
offsets, as given by user header ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS, minus
one is used.  If neither is available, 5 is used.  An error state
arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer than 3.  []

=item USEVAR = LOGICAL (Given)

Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]

=item WAVEPLATE_FLAT  = LOGICAL (Given)

Whether or not to make a flat for each polarimeter waveplate angle.
For non-polarimetric data, the value ofd the argument is immaterial.
For polarimetric data, false (0) means combine all waveplate angles to
make the flat (there should be an equal number of each angle).  [0]
