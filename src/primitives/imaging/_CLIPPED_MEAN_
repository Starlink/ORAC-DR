# Name:
#    _CLIPPED_MEAN_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the clipped mean of an object or sky frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    Use progressive sigma-clipping to find a representative mean of
#    an object frame.  The default clipping thresholds give a reasonable
#    approximation to the mode.
#
# Arguments:
#    CLIP = CHARACTER (Read)
#       The clipping limits as a comma-separated list. ["2,3,3"]
#    RESULT = REAL (Write)
#       The calculated clipped mean.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Only operates on OBJECT and SKY frames.
#
# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: STATS.
