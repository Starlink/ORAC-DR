# Name:
#    _GENERATE_OFFSETS_EXTENDED_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the offsets between the frames in an EXTENDED_nxm recipe,
#    and registers the frames.
#
# Description:
#    This primitive finds the pixel offsets between the target frames
#    in the current $Grp of an EXTENDED_nxm recipe.  The primitive
#    itself forms subgroups of either the target frames in a row or
#    all the target frames in a recipe cycle, if steering headers
#    MAKE_MOSAIC or MAKE_GRAND_MOSAIC are true respectively.  It then
#    passes the subgroups to other primitives to do the bulk of the
#    work.  When argument TELEOFF is true, _GENERATE_TELE_OFFSETS_ is
#    invoked and the derived offsets are used to register with a shift
#    of origin; otherwise _GENERATE_OFFSETS_ is the work horse.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Arguments:
#    COMPLETE = REAL (Given)
#       Completeness of matched features for registration between two
#       frames to be accepted.  It must be in the range 0.2 to 1.0. [0.5]
#    MINPIX = INTEGER (Given)
#       Minimum number of contiguous pixels above the PERCENTILE level
#       to be considered a registration feature.  It must be at least 6.
#       [12]
#    PERCENTILE = REAL (Given)
#       Percentile threshold for locating objects to register frames.
#       It must be in the range 75 to 99.9.  [98]
#    TELEOFF = LOGICAL (Given)
#       If true (1), it will just use the telescope offsets to register.
#       If false (0), it will attempt automatic registration.  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when either
#    steering headers MAKE_MOSAIC or MAKE_GRAND_MOSAIC is true.
#    -  Steering header CYCLE_NUMBER specifies the recipe cycle.
#    -  The _GENERATE_OFFSETS_ argument CENTRAL_SOURCE is FALSE.
#    -  The frames registered using telescope offsets are reported.

=head1 NAME

_GENERATE_OFFSETS_EXTENDED_ -- Find the offsets between the frames in an EXTENDED_I<n>xI<m> recipe, and registers the frames.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive finds the pixel offsets between the target frames in
the current $Grp of an EXTENDED_I<n>xI<m> recipe.  The primitive
itself forms subgroups of either the target frames in a row or all the
target frames in a recipe cycle, if steering headers MAKE_MOSAIC or
MAKE_GRAND_MOSAIC are true respectively.  It then passes the subgroups
to other primitives to do the bulk of the work.  When argument TELEOFF
is true, L<_GENERATE_TELE_OFFSETS_|_GENERATE_TELE_OFFSETS_> is invoked
and the derived offsets are used to register with a shift of origin;
otherwise L<_GENERATE_OFFSETS_|_GENERATE_OFFSETS_> is the work horse.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

Minimum number of contiguous pixels above the PERCENTILE level
to be considered a registration feature.  It must be at least 6.

=item PERCENTILE = REAL (Given)

Percentile threshold for locating objects to register frames.
It must be in the range 75 to 99.9.  [98]

=item TELEOFF = LOGICAL (Given)

If true (1), it will just use the telescope offsets to register.
If false (0), it will attempt automatic registration.  [0]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object and sky frames, and when either
steering headers MAKE_MOSAIC or MAKE_GRAND_MOSAIC is true.

=item *

Steering header CYCLE_NUMBER specifies the recipe cycle.

=item *

The _GENERATE_OFFSETS_ argument CENTRAL_SOURCE is FALSE.

=item *

For a partial automatic solution, tying the co-ordinate systems
becomes a question of finding the Cartesian displacements between
them.  It is done by comparing the telescope offsets with the
co-ordinates of the first object of the first automatically
registered frame.  Then this pair of displacements are added to
the approximate offsets of the remaining frames.
See L<_FIND_APPROX_OFFSETS_|_FIND_APPROX_OFFSETS_> for more information.

=item *

The frames registered using telescope offsets are reported.
