# Name:
#    _SET_REFERENCE_PIXEL_OFFSET_
#
# Purpose:
#    Sets the offsets of the reference pixel of the current frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive determines the displacements of the reference pixel
#    with respect to the centre of the current frame and stores the
#    displacements in the referenceoffset calibration system.  The
#    reference pixel is where a star would be placed for photometry
#    or the centre of a chopped and nodded pattern.
#
#    The initial reference pixel is specified by the ORAC_X_REFERENCE_PIXEL
#    and ORAC_Y_REFERENCE_PIXEL internal headers in the frame.  It is not
#    the reference offset of the source, but of some arbitrary point.
#    Therefore the displacements between the source and initial reference
#    position, allowing for the telescope offsets, are determined in
#    equatorial then pixel co-ordinates.  This enables the reference
#    position of the source to be determined, and hence its displacement
#    from the frame centre.

#    If either of the initial reference pixel co-ordinates does not exist
#    or is undefined, then the reference offset is zero for both axes.
#
# Notes:
#    - This primitive is suitable for NIRI in imaging mode.
#    - There is an information report giving the reference offset
#    for non-zero shifts.
#    - Should be called only from _IMAGING_HELLO_.

=head1 NAME

_SET_REFERENCE_PIXEL_OFFSET_ -- Sets the offsets of the reference pixel of the current frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive determines the displacements of the reference pixel
with respect to the centre of the current frame and stores the
displacements in the referenceoffset calibration system.   The
reference pixel is where a star would be placed for photometry
or the centre of a chopped and nodded pattern.

The initial reference pixel is specified by the ORAC_X_REFERENCE_PIXEL
and ORAC_Y_REFERENCE_PIXEL internal headers in the frame.  It is not
the reference offset of the source, but of some arbitrary point.
Therefore the displacements between the source and initial reference
position, allowing for the telescope offsets, are determined in
equatorial then pixel co-ordinates.  This enables the reference
position of the source to be determined, and hence its displacement
from the frame centre.

If either of the initial reference pixel co-ordinates does not exist
or is undefined, then the reference offset is zero for both axes.

=head1 NOTES
