# Name:
#    _GET_SATURATION_LEVEL_
#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the UFTI saturation level in ADU the current Frame.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive obtains the NIRI saturation level in ADU for the current
#    frame.
#
#    The saturation level is returned through an argument.
#
# Arguments:
#    SATURATION = REAL (Returned)
#       The saturation level obtained.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is only suitable for NIRI.
#    -  It merely uses a constant (23000) times the number of coadds,
#    there appears not to be a header giving the bias (and hence the
#    depth of the well).
