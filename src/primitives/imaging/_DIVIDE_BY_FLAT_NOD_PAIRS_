# Name:
#    _DIVIDE_BY_FLAT_NOD_PAIRS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Flat-fields the frames in a differenced-pair group.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive divides each frame in the current cycle of a
#    differenced-pair group, referenced in the group internal header
#    DIFFERENCE_GROUP, by the most-recent and matching flat-field frame
#    invoking _DIVIDE_BY_FLAT_.
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs when the steering header FLAT_DIVIDE is
#    true.
#    -  The cycle number is given by steering header CYCLE_NUMBER.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Flat-fielded frames each inheriting the primary frame's name
#    but with the _ff suffix.

=head1 NAME

_DIVIDE_BY_FLAT_NOD_PAIRS_ -- Flat-fields the frames in a differenced-pair group.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive divides each frame in the current cycle of a
differenced-pair group, referenced in the group internal header
DIFFERENCE_GROUP, by the most-recent and matching flat-field frame
invoking L<_DIVIDE_BY_FLAT_|_DIVIDE_BY_FLAT_>.

=head1 NOTES

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs when the steering header FLAT_DIVIDE is true.

=item *

The cycle number is given by steering header CYCLE_NUMBER.
