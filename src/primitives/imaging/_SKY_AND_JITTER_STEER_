# Name:
#    _SKY_AND_JITTER_STEER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Steers processing for SKY_AND_JITTER recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive control processing for SKY_AND_JITTER recipes through
#    steering headers listed below.
#
# Steering Headers:
#    CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
#       pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.
#    DO_APHOT = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not perform aperture photometry.  Photometry is
#       performed once the mosaic is made.
#    FILE_SKY = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to file the frame as sky.  This is only true for the
#       first frame in a cycle.
#    JITTER_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of target frames in the jitter.
#    MAKE_MOSAIC = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not register the frames and make the mosaic.  The mosaic
#       is made once all the jittered target frames in a cycle are available.
#    SUBTRACT_SKY = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to subtract the sky from the frame.  This is only
#       false for the first frame in a cycle.
#    TARGET_OR_SKY = CHARACTER
#       This is "target" for a target frame, and "sky" for a sky calibration
#       frame.  The first frame in the cycle is sky and the remainder
#       are targets.
#    USE_VARIANCE = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not variance processing is to occur.  This equates to
#       argument USEVAR.
#
# Arguments:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER (Given)
#       The number of frames in the jitter, excluding the sky frame.
#       If absent, the number of offsets, as given by user header
#       ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS, minus two is used.  If neither is
#       available, 5 is used.  An error state arises if the number of
#       jittered frames is fewer than 3.  []
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object and sky frames.

# iterators.  By convention there is always an offset to the origin at

# ORAC_NUMBER_OF_OFFSETS-2 in the jitter.
