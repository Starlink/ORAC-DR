# Name:
#    _MASK_DEVIANTS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Masks pixels which are deviant from the neighbourhood.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive applies a filter to the current frame, which masks
#    deviant pixels to create a masked frame.  The supplied frame is
#    block smoothed with a 15x15-pixel kernel.  A pixel which deviates
#    fmean rom its local mean by more +/-3 standard deviations about the
#    is replaced by a bad pixel in the output array.  A new standard
#    deviation is derived and the process is repeated twice.  The bad
#    pixels are assigned the Starlink bad (`magic') value.  The 
#    primitive reports a successful masking and the frames concerned.
#
# Arguments:
#    CLIP = STRING (Given)
#       Set the clipping levels and number of clipping iterations to
#       perform. This must be in the format [level,level2,...], where
#       multiple clipping levels are contained in square brackets.
#       ["[3,3,3]"]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  The masked image can be displayed.
#    -  The frame title is "Deviant pixels masked".
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Deviant-masked frame inheriting the current frame's name 
#    but with the _md suffix.

_MASK_DEVIANTS_ -- Masks pixels which are deviant from the neighbourhood.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive applies a filter to the current frame, which masks
deviant pixels to create a masked frame.  The supplied frame is
block smoothed with a 15x15-pixel kernel.  A pixel which deviates
fmean rom its local mean by more +/-3 standard deviations about the
is replaced by a bad pixel in the output array.  A new standard
deviation is derived and the process is repeated twice.  The bad
pixels are assigned the Starlink bad (`magic') value.  The 
primitive reports a successful masking and the frames concerned.
