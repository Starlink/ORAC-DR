# Name:
#    _QUADRANT_JITTER_STEER_
#
# Purpose:
#    Steers processing for QUADRANT_JITTER recipes.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description: 
#    This primitive control processing for QUADRANT_JITTER recipes through
#    steering headers listed below.
#
# Steering Headers:
#    CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER
#       Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
#       pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.
#    MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to make the flat.  A flat is made once all the
#       frames in a cycle are available.
#    MAKE_MOSAIC = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not register the frames and make a row mosaic.  A
#       mosaic is made once all the frames in a cycle are available.
#    MASK_OBJECTS = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to mask the objects.  Masking occurs when all the
#       jittered frames in a cycle are available.
#    REFERENCE_FRAME = LOGICAL
#       A true value specifies the reference frame for normalisation
#       of the masked frames.  It is true for the first frame
#       and false for all subsequent frames in the observation.
#    USE_VARIANCE = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not variance processing is to occur.  This equates to
#       argument USEVAR.
#
# Arguments:
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL (Given)
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle 
#    in imaging mode.
#    -  Processing only occurs for object frames.

# Added by CGT/AAO Sep 2003.

# All frames are targets.  Some more-general primitives need to select 
# targets from sky frames.

_QUADRANT_JITTER_STEER_ -- Steers processing for QUADRANT_JITTER recipes.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive control processing for QUADRANT_JITTER recipes through
steering headers listed below.

=head1 STEERING HEADERS

=over 4

=item CYCLE_NUMBER = INTEGER

Number of the cycle, a cycle being a set of frames to complete a
pass through the recipe.  The first cycle is 0.

=item MAKE_FLAT = LOGICAL

Whether or not to make the flat.  A flat is made once all the
frames in a cycle are available.

=item MAKE_MOSAIC = LOGICAL

Whether or not register the frames and make a row mosaic.  A
mosaic is made once all the frames in a cycle are available.

=item MASK_OBJECTS = LOGICAL

Whether or not to mask the objects.  Masking occurs when all the
jittered frames in a cycle are available.

=item REFERENCE_FRAME = LOGICAL

A true value specifies the reference frame for normalisation
of the masked frames.  It is true for the first frame
and false for all subsequent frames in the observation.

=item USE_VARIANCE = LOGICAL

Whether or not variance processing is to occur.  This equates to
argument USEVAR.

=item USEVAR = LOGICAL (Given)

Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]

=head1 NOTES

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle in imaging mode.

=item *

Processing only occurs for object frames.
