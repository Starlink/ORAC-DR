=head1 NAME

_COADD_TO_GROUP_ - Coadds a quad to a group, then forms a datacube.

=head1 Description

This primitive coadds the current quad into the appropriate group.
Images are extracted from the cube at this point. The datacube is divided by a
standard star spectrum and flux calibrated unless the NOSTD option is
used. Finally, images and a spectrum are extracted from the datacube.

=head1 Notes

=over 4

=item *

This primitive does nothing if the current frame is not the fourth of
a quad.

=item *

This primitive coadds 2d spectra before forming them into a
datacube. This is therefore only suitable for use when there is no
offset between object frames.

=head1 Parameters

=over 4

=item NOSTD

Prevents division by a standard star spectrum and flux calibration.
