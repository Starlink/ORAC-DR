=head1 NAME

_FORM_QUAD_ - Forms a quad by averaging together two pairs.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive forms a quad by averaging together two pairs. It determines
which pairs to average by examining the QUAD_STEP argument. This argument
refers to an internal header set by one of the preceding primitives, such that
this primitive will use the output of that primitive.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item CLEAN = LOGICAL (Given)

If this parameter is true (1) then cleaning of hot pixels and cosmics
will be done after the quad has been formed. [1]

=item QUAD_STEP = CHARACTER (Given)

The name of the internal header and tag that this primitive will use
to do averaging. The tag must be set to this primitive can refer
to a specific file, and the header must be set so a subgroup can be
formed. If one (or both) of the header and tag is not set, then
errors will happen. [SCRUNCH_RESULT]
