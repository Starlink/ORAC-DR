_PAIRWISE_SUBTRACT_NOD_TO_SKY_

Subtract object-sky pairs

=head1 Description

If a pair is complete then the sky frame is subtracted from the object
frame. The resulting 2d spectrum is scrunched to give all rows a
common wavelength scale. Intermediate frames are then deleted.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item SKY_OFFSET = INTEGER (Given)

If a frame has an absolute telescope offset greater than the number
of arcseconds given by this argument, it will be classified as a 
sky frame. [30]

=head1 Notes

=over 4

=item *

The spectroscopy primitive _PAIR_REDUCTION_SUBTRACT_ is used to
actually do the subtraction.

=item *

The primitive _PAIR_REDUCTION_STEER_ is used to determine when a pair
is complete. This primitive sets the an entry called PAIR_COMPLETE in
the user defined header.

=item *

If the pair is not complete then this primitve does nothing.
