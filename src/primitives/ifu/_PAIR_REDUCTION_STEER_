=head1 Name

PAIR_REDUCTION_STEER

Control reduction of sky-object pairs

=head1 Description

This is a steering primitive. It does not generate any output frames,
but sets user defined headers in the current frame to control
subsequent reduction.

=head1 Headers

=over 4

=item PAIR_COMPLETE

This header is set to 1 if the current group contains an even number
of frames or 0 otherwise.

=item QUAD_COMPLETE

This header is set to 1 if the current frame is the 4th, 8th, etc.,
observation in the group, and 0 otherwise.

=item ON_SOURCE

This header is set to 1 if the observation type is OBJECT and the
telescope offsets are less than the amount given in the SKY_OFFSET
argument, otherwise 0.

=item SKY_SUBTRACTION_RESULT

This header defaults to 0. It is set when sky subtraction is done.

=back

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item SKY_OFFSET = INTEGER (Given)

If a frame has an absolute telescope offset greater than the number
of arcseconds given by this argument, it will be classified as a 
sky frame. [30]

=back

=head1 Notes

It is recommended that the observation type is set to OBJECT/SKY as
appropriate. Sometimes this is inconvenient (when setting a complex 
jitter pattern for use with MAP_EXTENDED_SOURCE the offset iterator in
ORAC-OT may be useful), so any positions with total telescope offset 
larger than the value given by the SKY_OFFSET argument are assumed to
be a sky position.
