=head1 NAME

_COADD_TO_GROUP_POINT_

=head1 Description

This primitive expects the current frame to be a sky-subtracted,
scrunched, 2d spectrum. The spectrum is added to the current group
which is then formed into a datacube. The datacube is divided by a
standard star spectrum and flux calibrated unless the NOSTD option is
used. Finally, images and a spectrum are extracted from the datacube.

The spectrum is optimally extracted using a generated profile.

=head1 Notes

=over 4

=item *

This primitive does nothing if the current frame is not the second of
an object-sky pair.

=item *

This primitive coadds 2d spectra before forming them into a
datacube. This is therefore only suuitable for use when there is no
offset between object frames.

=head1 Parameters

=over 4
