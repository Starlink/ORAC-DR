=head1 NAME

_FILE_FLAT_ - Files a frame as the current flat for spectroscopy data.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This generic primitive files the current frame as the current flat.
It also adds the flat to the index of flat frames.  Both steps are
reported.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The number of files in the current frame must be one.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

Frame flat_I<n>, where I<n> is the original frame number, is a copy of
of the supplied frame.
