=head1 NAME

_GET_HEADER_STEPTIME_ - Try to provide a value for STEPTIME header

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive checks each file in the frame to determine whether
its STEPTIME header is blank.  If so a value is obtained from the
OCS configuration XML.  New values are stored in the C<uhdr>
WESLEY_SET_HEADERS (for subsequent writing by C<_SET_HEADERS_>).
