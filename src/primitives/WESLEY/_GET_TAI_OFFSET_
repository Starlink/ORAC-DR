=head1 NAME

_GET_TAI_OFFSET_ - Get the offset between TAI and UTC

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reads the offset from the C<uhdr> ORAC_TAI_UTC_CORRECTION,
or if this is not available, retrieves it using C<Astro::PAL::palDat>
for the date given by the C<uhdr> ORAC_UTSTART.

The offset is returned (in seconds) via the primitive hash:

    my $dtai = $_GET_TAI_OFFSET_{'DTAI'};
