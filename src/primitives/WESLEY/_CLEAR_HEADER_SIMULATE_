=head1 NAME

_CLEAR_HEADER_SIMULATE_ - Clears true values from the SIMULATE header

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive checks the SIMULATE FITS header for each file in the
frame and if true, places a false value in the C<uhdr>
WESLEY_SET_HEADERS (for subsequent writing by C<_SET_HEADERS_>) under
the assumption that if this primitive is being called, it has been
determined that the header value is spurious.
