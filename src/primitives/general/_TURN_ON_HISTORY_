# Name:
#    _TURN_ON_HISTORY_
#
# Purpose:
#    Switches on history recording.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive enables NDF history recording for each integration
#    in an observation.
#
# Notes:
#    - This primitive is suitable for UFTI, IRCAM, and Michelle and
#    UIST in imaging mode.
#    - If the ORAC_HISTORY_OFF environment variable is set, then
#    history will be disabled.
#
# Tasks:
#    KAPPA: HISSET.
