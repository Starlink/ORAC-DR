=head1 NAME

_TRIGGER_ESTAR_ - Send photometry results back to eSTAR embedded agent

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If the data are associated with a trigger from the eSTAR network,
this primitive sends the photometry results back to the user agent.
The results are tagged with the particular eSTAR trigger ID and
includes a catalogue of photometry results and the reduced group.

This primitive is skipped automatically if the headers do not
indicate this is an eSTAR observation.

If this trigger has already been handled by the eSTAR agent
the results will be ignored. It is possible that the agent
will not be running. If this is the case, a warning is issued
but the pipeline does not stop processing.

=head1 TODO

 - Triggers must be disabled if the pipeline is not running
   on a UKIRT machine.

 - A log file of triggers should be created. This should indicate
   whether the trigger was accepted by the embedded agent.

  # Quick hack to send multiple messages on trigger, need both 'update' and
  # 'observation' messages. Brad, read carefully before making further changes.

  #
  # Note that there are two types of alert the ORAC-DR pipeline should
  # send to the eSTAR agent. An 'update' alert and an 'observation' alert.
  # An update alert is currently ignored by the agent, but should come at
  # the end of each observation frame, a 'observation' alert comes at the
  # end of all processing pointing to the final data products. For now
  # lets hardwire the sending of both alerts, after all we've just finished
  # a frame, and then (since the observation currently only consists of
  # a single frame) we need an update message to say that frame is done and
  # then immediately an observation message to say the observation is
  # done.
