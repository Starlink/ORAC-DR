=head1 NAME

_GET_REFERENCE_FLUX_ - Return the reference flux for a given waveband.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive returns a reference flux for a given waveband. This
information is used in flux calibration.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item BAND = CHARACTER (Given)

Waveband for which the flux will be returned. Must be one of
V, I, J, H, K, L, Lprime, M, N, or Q. []

=item FLUX = REAL (Returned)

Flux in the requested waveband.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The flux is returned in units of W/m^2/micron.

=item *

If the flux cannot be determined, the returned flux will be
"UNKNOWN". This will be the case if the waveband is not one of
those listed above.
