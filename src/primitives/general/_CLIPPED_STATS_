=head1 NAME

_CLIPPED_STATS_ -- Finds the clipped mean and standard deviation of a
frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use progressive sigma-clipping to find a representative mean and
standard deviation of a frame.  The default clipping thresholds give a
reasonable approximation to the mode.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item CLIP = CHARACTER (Read)

The clipping limits as a comma-separated list. ["2,3,3"]

=item MEAN = REAL (Write)

The calculated clipped mean.

=item SIGMA = REAL (Write)

The calculated clipped standard deviation.

=item NUMBER = INTEGER (Write)

The number of good pixels used to derive the statistics.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for all instruments.
