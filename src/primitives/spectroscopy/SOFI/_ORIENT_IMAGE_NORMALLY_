=head1 NAME

_ORIENT_IMAGE_NORMALLY_ - Transforms the image to the normal orientation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Some instruments produce an image in an unusual orientation 
- e.g. the wavelength might increase from right to left rather 
than left to right.  We use this primitive to re-orientate the 
image to a more conventional orientation - i.e. slit runs up/down, 
short wavelength is to the left, long wavelength to the right.

This version of the primitive is intended for SOFI spectroscopic data
where the slit is aligned with the x axis, not the customary y.
