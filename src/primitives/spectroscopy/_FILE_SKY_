_FILE_SKY_ - Files a sky observation with the calibration system.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive files the current frame as the current sky. It also
adds the sky to the index of sky frames. Both steps are reported.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The current frame should be a SKY. If it is not, a warning message
appears but the frame will be filed regardless.

=item *

The number of files in the current frame must be one.
