_DETERMINE_NREADS_ - Determine the number of array reads / exposure

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Adds a Frame user header (NREADS) that contains the number of
array reads per exposure.

In this (CGS4 specific) version, this is determined from the
exposure time and mode - by knowing (or guessing) what the ALICE
is programmed to do.

The algorithm is as follows:

for exposure times <= 1 second, nreads = 2
  - one at the start and one at the end

for exposure times > 1 sec, but <= 149.9
  - read out every second, thus nreads = exptime+1

for exposure times > 149.9 secs,
  - read out every 5 secs, thus nreads = 1+exptime/5
