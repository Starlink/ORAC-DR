=head1 NAME

_SPECTROSCOPY_HELLO_ - The first step in processing spectroscopy data.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The first step in processing spectroscopy data. 

=over 4

=item 1 

Calls _MAKE_RAW_FILE_ to copy the frame to a _raw file in $ORAC_DATA_OUT

=item 2 

Switches on History recording

=item 3

Adds the frame to the on-the-fly nightlog.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

None.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

C<_raw> files are created by _MAKE_RAW_FILE_ which is called from this primitive

=head1 NOTES

Calls the following primitives:
