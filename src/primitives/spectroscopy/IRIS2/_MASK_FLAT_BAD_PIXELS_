=head1 NAME

_MASK_FLAT_BAD_PIXELS_ - Flags as bad pixels in the flat that are deviant
compared to to nearby pixels.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive marks as bad those pixels in the flat that are
significantly different from the pixels nearby. It does this by
using a box five pixels wide to smooth any pixels that are more
than 5-sigma away from its neighbours. This helps mask the majority
of pixels in columns 510 and 512 of raw IRIS2 spectroscopic flats,
which tend to have negative counts.

The result is stored in a file with a _mnf suffix.
