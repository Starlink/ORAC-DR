# Name:
#    _ARRAY_TEST_STATISTICS_
#
# Purpose:
#    Determines the state of the IRIS2 detector for the ARRAY_TESTS
#    recipe.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive evaluates the readout noise in electrons and the
#    dark current in electrons per second for IRIS2.  The script also
#    reports these statistics, indicating whether or not they are
#    nominal.  At AAO, the results are also logged to a text file,
#    /inst2_soft/iris2red/logs/array_tests.log, to monitor secular trends.
#    The mode, speed, and readnoise are written to the calibration index.
#
#    The primitive expects sets of four dark frames.  In each set the first
#    dark frame is ignored, then come two 5 sec dark frames, followed
#    by a 60 sec dark.
#
# Notes:
#    -  The exposure time comes from the ORAC_EXPOSURE_TIME header,
#    defaulting to 60.0s if the header is undefined.  The ADU comes
#    from the _GET_GAIN_ primitive.
#    -  If the log file does not exist, a new one is created containing
#    a two-line heading, and the fact is reported.
#    -  The log file stores the results in a fixed columnar format.
#    -  The noise is the standard deviation per frame of the second and
#    third frames subtracted, and converted from counts to electrons.
#    -  The dark current is the three-sigma-clipped mean count of the
#    60 sec dark normalised to unit time and converted to electrons.
#    -  The nominal readout noise is 8 to 15 electrons, and the nominal
#    dark current is -1 to 1 electron per second.
#
# Deficiencies:
#    -  There is no validation of the frame types.

=head1 NAME

_ARRAY_TEST_STATISTICS_ -- Determines the state of the IRIS2 detector for the ARRAY_TESTS recipe.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive evaluates the readout noise in electrons and the
dark current in electrons per second for IRIS2.  The script also
reports these statistics, indicating whether or not they are
nominal.  At AAO, the results are also logged to a text file,
F</inst2_soft/iris2red/logs/array_tests.log>, to monitor secular trends.
The DRM readnoise is written to the calibration index.

The primitive expects sets of four frames.  In each set the first
refresh frame is ignored, then come two DRM frames, followed
by a dark.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The exposure time comes from the ORAC_EXPOSURE_TIME header,
defaulting to 60.0s if the header is undefined.  The ADU comes
from the L<_GET_GAIN_|_GET_GAIN_> primitive.

=item *

If the log file does not exist, a new one is created containing
a two-line heading, and the fact is reported.

=item *

The log file stores the results in a fixed columnar format.

=item *

The noise is the standard deviation per frame of the second and
third frames subtracted, and converted from counts to electrons.

=item *

The dark current is the three-sigma-clipped mean count of the
dark count normalised to unit time and converted to electrons.

=item *

The nominal readout noise is 8 to 15 electrons, and the nominal
dark current is -1 to 1 electron per second.
