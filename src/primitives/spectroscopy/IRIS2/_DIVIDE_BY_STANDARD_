=head1 NAME

_DIVIDE_BY_STANDARD_ - Divides a spectrum or an array by a suitable standard.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Asks the calibration system for a suitable standard star, and divides by it.
This primitive works for either 1D or 2D data.

This primitive outputs a file with a _dbs suffix for 1D data, or a _dbsi
suffix for 2D data.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The input frames should have been normalised to 1 second exposures.

=item *

Only works if the user header PAIR_COMPLETE is true, i.e. we have come
to a frame that completes a pair.

  #      is to look for any shift in sky lines, but these have
