=head1 NAME

_PAIR_REDUCTION_COADD_TO_GROUP_POL_ - Coadd a completed pair to a reduced group
for polarimetry data.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive coadds subtracted pairs into their respective group, which
is determined by the waveplate angle. The group is stored as a reference in
the current $Grp's E<lt>ANGLEE<gt>_GROUP uhdr group, i.e. for
the 0-degree waveplate angle observations, the Group object referenced
to in the current $Grp's 0_GROUP uhdr is used.

The resulting frame is an average of the pairs that were coadded into it,
so the exposure time of that resulting frame is the same as the exposure
time of each individual pair.

The start and end airmasses and UT times of the coadded group are revised
to the limiting values for the first and last contributing frames
respectively.
