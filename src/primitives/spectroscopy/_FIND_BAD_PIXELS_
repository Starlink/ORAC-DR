=head1 NAME

_FIND_BAD_PIXELS_ - Finds bad pixels in a frame.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Used in array tests to add the bad pixels detected in this frame into the 
bad pixel mask.

Applies thresholds to the data frames and flags pixels outside
the limits as bad.

For BIAS frames, we do a 3-sigma clipped stats and flag pixels more
than 6 sigma from the mean. The actual threshold limits applied are
reported. In addition, we also flag pixels whose BIAS variance is more
than 6-sigma above the mean in a 3-sigma clipped stats.

For DARK frames, we set the thresholds to 1700 and 15 if the exposure
is greater than 80 seconds, and 1500 and -100 if it is not. This will
need updating if MICHELLE elects to use an automated bad pixel
detection scheme in the future and when UIST support is added - these
values are CGS4 specific.

The bad pixels detected are added into the current bad pixel mask and
then this is filed with the calibration system as a new and current
bad pixel mask.
