# Name:
#    _EXTRACT_FIND_ROWS_ 

#
# Purpose:
#    Finds the rows containing the spectra.
#
# Language:
#    Perl5
#
# Description:
#    This primitive finds the rows in a group image at which to centre the
#    spectral-extraction windows. 
#
#    These are stored in a Group user-header called BEAMS, which is a
#    reference to an array of references to hashes, each hash having keys
#    POS and MULT, specifiying the beam position and multiplier
#    respectively.
#
#    Any residual bias in the supplied frame is removed by taking a
#    multiply clipped mean from the data.  A zero background helps the
#    identification of the spectral rows, both avoiding additional noise
#    peaks or making a beam undetected.
#
#    When determining the location of the rows on which the spectra fall,
#    a y-profile spectrum is created by taking the median to remove the
#    effects of outliers.  The profile is then thresholded at zero to
#    separate the positive and negative beams, which are analysed
#    separately.
#
# Arguments:
#    ROWSCAL = CHARACTER (Given)
#       If this is set to "SAVE", the primitive will store the beam
#       information it detects to the calibration rows system.  If it 
#       is set to "LOAD", the primitive will ask the calibration system
#       for the beam information rather than trying to determine it from
#       the data.  If unset, the beam information will be determined from
#       the image, and used without being stored to the calibration
#       system.
#    SMOOTH = INTEGER (Given)
#        A positive integer applies a median filter using a kernel size
#        of SMOOTH rounded up to the next whole odd integer.  If it is
#        not positive, no smoothing occurs.  [0]
#
# Notes:
#    -  The number of beams found is compared with the expected
#    number.  If the totals are not equal, say becuase of low
#    signal-to-noise, user header NBEAMS is set to 0, implying no
#    extraction.
#    -  The primitive reports the location, strength, and multiplier of
#    each peak found; or reports that the beam information came from the
#    calibration system.
#    -  The negative beam is multiplied by -1 before analysis.
#    -  If not all the beams are located, group user header NBEAMS is
#    set to zero.
#
# Output Data:
#    -  Residual sky-subtracted frame inheriting the frame's name but with 
#    the _srs suffix.
#    -  The one-dimensional collapsed spectral-axis profile inheriting the
#    frame's name but with the _ypr suffix.

=head1 NAME

_EXTRACT_FIND_ROWS_ -- Finds the rows containing the spectra.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive finds the rows in a group image at which to centre the
spectral-extraction windows. 

These are stored in a Group user-header called BEAMS, which is a
reference to an array of references to hashes, each hash having keys
POS and MULT, specifiying the beam position and multiplier
respectively.

Any residual bias in the supplied frame is removed by taking a
multiply clipped mean from the data.  A zero background helps the
identification of the spectral rows, both avoiding additional noise
peaks or making a beam undetected.

When determining the location of the rows on which the spectra fall,
a I<y>-profile spectrum is created by taking the median to remove the
effects of outliers.  The profile is then thresholded at zero to
separate the positive and negative beams, which are analysed
separately.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item ROWSCAL = CHARACTER (Given)

If this is set to "SAVE", the primitive will store the beam
information it detects to the calibration rows system.  If it 
is set to "LOAD", the primitive will ask the calibration system
for the beam information rather than trying to determine it from
the data.  If unset, the beam information will be determined from
the image, and used without being stored to the calibration
system.
 
=item SMOOTH = INTEGER (Given)

A positive integer applies a median filter using a kernel size
of SMOOTH rounded up to the next whole odd integer.  If it is
not positive, no smoothing occurs.  [0]

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The number of beams found is compared with the expected
number.  If the totals are not equal, say becuase of low
signal-to-noise, user header NBEAMS is set to 0, implying no
extraction.

=item *

The primitive reports the location, strength, and multiplier of
each peak found; or reports that the beam information came from the
calibration system.

=item *

The negative beam is multiplied by -1 before analysis.

=item *

If not all the beams are located, group user header NBEAMS is
set to zero.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

Residual sky-subtracted frame inheriting the frame's name but with 
the _ss suffix.

=item *

The one-dimensional collapsed spectral-axis profile inheriting the
frame's name but with the _ypr suffix.
