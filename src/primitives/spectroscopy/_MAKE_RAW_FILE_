=head1 NAME

_MAKE_RAW_FILE_ - Copies raw data to a _mraw file.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Copies it's input data (which is usually the raw data from
$ORAC_DATA_IN) data to a _mraw file in $ORAC_DATA_OUT, making it into a
single NDF if possible, retaining the HDS structure otherwise.

If a single NDF is being created, we call the display system to display
the _mraw file.

This is the first step in _SPECTROSCOPY_HELLO_, and allows to to carry
out in-place manipulations of the "raw" files without needing write
access to ORAC_DATA_IN or worrying about modifying the real raw data
files, which are considered, to the instrument scientist at least, to
be sacred.
