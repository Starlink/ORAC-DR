=head1 NAME

_MASK_BAD_BASELINE_LINEARITY_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive identifies bad detectors by comparing the deviation from
linearity of each detector's baseline.

It first creates a mean spectrum for each detector by collapsing the
time axis using a 2-sigma-clipped-mean estimator from all the subfiles
in the observation.  Then it filters the mean spectra:
  - thresholding to +/-20 to exclude strong spikes;
  - masking emission regions where the astronomical line may be present
    (see LINEWIDTH argument); and
  - determines the background level, effectively smoothing to remove
    structure smaller than a nominated scale (see SCALELENGTH argument).

The script then fits linear baselines to the smoothed spectra and
calculates the rms residuals.  From these it determines a mean rms
residual per detector for the central 85%.  This trimming excludes the
ends of the spectra that are known to be unreliable and exhibit random
large variations that would swamp the non-linearity signal the
primitive is attempting to detect.  The mean rms residual per detector
is printed.

The primitive then rejects receptors by one of two methods:
kappa-sigma clipping or a fixed threshold set by the RMS_THRESHOLD
argument.  For the former the primitive then evaluates the median and
standard deviation of the distribution of mean rms residuals from the
entire observation, and performs iterative sigma clipping above the
median to reject those detectors whose deviations from linearity are
anomalous, subjected to a minimum rejection threshold given by the
MINRMS argument.

The rejected receptors are then marked bad in the output cube, and
recorded in the bad_receptors_qa calibration.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item CLIP = STRING (Given)

The maximum number of standard deviations above the median rms
deviations for which a detector's non-linearity is regarded as
acceptable.  The minimum allowed is 2.  A comma-separated list will
perform iterative sigma clipping of outliers, but standard deviations
in the list should not decrease.  This argument can be overridden by
the RECPAR_BASELINE_LINEARITY_CLIP uhdr via the recipe parameter
system.  ["2.0,2.3,3.0"]

=item LINEWIDTH = STRING (Given)

This specifies the location of spectral-line emission.  It can be
either "auto", which requests that the emission be found
automatically; or it is the extent(s) of the source spectral line(s)
measured in km/s, supplied in a comma-separated list.  For the latter
each range may be given as bounds separated by a colon; or as a single
value being the width about zero.  For instance "-20:50" would excise
the region -20 to +50 km/s, and "30" would exclude the -15 to +15 km/s
range. This argument can be overridden by the
RECPAR_BASELINE_LINEARITY_LINEWIDTH uhdr via the recipe parameter
system.  ["auto"]

=item MASK = LOGICAL (Given)

Whether or not to mask bad detectors.  Masking is needed if a
subsequent bad-baseline removal technique is employed.  [1]

=item MINRMS = REAL (Given)

The minimum rms deviation from linearity for a receptor to be flagged
as bad.  It avoids rejection of good receptors where one or two are
slighlty more uneven than most or just have some transient baseline
issues.  This argument sets an absolute limit, not just rejection
based upon an intercomparison.  Values between 0.05 and 0.2 are
normal. Most good receptors will be in 0.02 to 0.05 range.  This
argument can be overridden by the RECPAR_BASELINE_LINEARITY_MINRMS
uhdr via the recipe parameter system.  [0.1]

=item RMS_THRESHOLD = REAL (Given)

Instead of iteratively clipping outliers, reject all receptors who rms
deviation from linearity exceeds this value.  The minimum allowed
value is 0.02.  If it is undefined, the kappa-sigma clipping is used
to reject outlying receptors.  This argument can be overridden by the
RECPAR_BASELINE_LINEARITY_RMS_THRESHOLD uhdr via the recipe parameter
system.  [undef]

=item SCALELENGTH = INTEGER (Given)

The smoothing scale length in pixels.  Features narrower than this are
filtered out during the background-level determination.  It should be
should be odd (if an even value is supplied, the next higher odd value
will be used) and sufficiently large to remove the noise while not
removing the low-frequency patterns in the spectra. The minimum
allowed is 51.  This argument can be overridden by the
RECPAR_BASELINE_LINEARITY_SCALELENGTH uhdr via the recipe parameter
system.  [101]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for ACSIS/HARP time-series data.  The
restriction to HARP is to ensure there are sufficient receptors to
derive meaningful statistics and hence identify outliers.

=item *

This primitive is suitable for spectral-line observations.

=item *

This primitive will not run if the BASELINE_LINEARITY recipe parameter
is set false (0).

=item *

The 85% trimming of the spectra is the same trim applied in the
QA primitives.

=item *

The primitive excludes analysis of the bad receptors, defaulting to
those listed in either the master (F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/index.bad_receptors>)
or the local index F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.bad_receptors_qa>).

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

A cleaned version of the supplied time-series cube in which the noisy
detectors are set to bad.  It has the suffix _bllmasked (for
BaseLine Linearity).
