=head1 NAME

_MASK_TIMESERIES_DATA_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive applies a time-series mask to time-series data to mask
out emission.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item *

None.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for ACSIS data.

=item *

The input masks are recorded via Group internal header TIMESERIES_MASKS.

=item *

The names of the output files are stored the Group internal header
MASKED_TIMESERIES.

=item *

Neither the Frame nor Group object are updated.  However, the output
files are logged as group intermediates.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The baselined timeseries data with suffix _msk.

=head1 TASKS

KAPPA: ADD.

=head1 REQUIRED PERL MODULES
