=head1 NAME

_PASTE_SUBSCANS_BY_RECEPTOR_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive pastes the time-series cubes' subscans for a single
receptor into a single file.  A subsection along the dispersion axis
may be provided through the SECTION argument.

When all the subscans have the same number of spectra, only one call
to paste is needed, otherwise each subscan is pasted individually.
(Another approach would be to shift the origins.)

The concatenated bounds corresponding to each original subsccan is
returned through Argument BOUNDS.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item BOUNDS = REFERENCE (Given & Returned)

The lower then upper temporal-axis bounds of each subscan within the
output file.  If supplied on input these will be the bounds used to
form the concatenated cube, and should comprise twice the number of
subscans.  The intention is to compute this once for the first receptor
and reuse for the remainder.

=item FILE = STRING (Given)

The name of the file in which to store the concatenated cube.
An error will result if this is not supplied.

=item RECEPTOR = STRING (Given)

The name of the receptor, e.g. H00, whose subscans are to be
concatenated.  An error will result if this argument is not defined.

=item SAMESIZE = BOOLEAN (Given & Returned)

Whether or not the subscans are of equal dimension along the temporal
axis.  The intention is to compute this once for the first receptor
and reuse for the remainder.

=item SECTION = STRING (Given)

The NDF section along the spectral axis to permit, for example, the
trimming of the noisy ends.  ["~85%"]

observations.
