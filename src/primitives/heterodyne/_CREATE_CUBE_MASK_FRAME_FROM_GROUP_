=head1 NAME

_CREATE_CUBE_MASK_FRAME_FROM_GROUP_ - Create a cube masking out lines
from a timeseries mask.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes a timeseries cube with its lines masked out and
creates a spatial cube from it.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item PARAM1 = REAL (Given)

The first parameter required by the spreading method. This parameter
is required by all methods, and specifies how many arcseconds on
either side of the output position are to receive contributions from
the input pixel. A value of zero indicates that a suitable number
should be calculated automatically. [0]

=item PARAM2 = REAL (Given)

The second parameter required by the spreading method, but only for
SombCos, Gauss, SincSinc, SincCos, and SincGauss schemes. For the
SombCos, SincSinc, and SincCos schemes, it specifies the number of
arcseconds at which the envelope of the function goes to zero. The
minimum value is 1.0, and the run-time default value is 2.0.  For the
Gauss and SincGauss scheme, it specifies the full-width at
half-maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian envelope.  The minimum value is
0.1, and the run-time default is 1.0. []

=item PIXSIZE = REAL (Given)

The output pixel scale. If not defined, this value is automatically
determined from the data. []

=item SPREAD = STRING (Given)

The method to use when spreading each input pixel out between a group
of neighbouring output pixels when using MAKECUBE to generate the
cube. ['nearest']

=item TILEBORDER = INTEGER (Given)

The number of pixels to add as a border when creating tiled
cubes. This should be large enough to compensate for edge effects for
non-nearest spread functions. [0]

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The timeseries masks are obtained from the TIMESERIES_MASKS Group uhdr.

=item *

The output masks are stored in the Group's member Frame objects uhdrs
as an array reference in the BASELINE_MASKS uhdr. The first index
(i.e. index 0) is undef.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The cube masking out lines with suffix _cubemask.

=back

=head1 TASKS

None, but see _CREATE_CUBE_FRAME_.

=head1 REQUIRED PERL MODULES

None.
