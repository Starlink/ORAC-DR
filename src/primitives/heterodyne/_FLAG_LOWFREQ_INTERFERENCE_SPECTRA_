=head1 NAME

_FLAG_LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE_SPECTRA_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive identifies and masks spectra affected by low-frequency
noise.

It achieves this through the following steps.
  -  Creates a non-linearity map for each subfile cube of an observation.
     o  Thresholds the cube to +/-20 to exclude strong spikes.
     o  Masks emission regions where the astronomical line may be present
        (see LINEWIDTH argument), and trims the outer 15% where noise is
        always present.
     o  Determines the background level, effectively smoothing to remove
        structure smaller than a nominated scale (see SCALELENGTH argument).
     o  Fits linear baselines to the smoothed spectra and calculates the rms
        residuals.
     o  Derives an rms non-linearity array to provide a rectified signal.
     o  Averages the signal along the spectral axis to form a non-linearity
        profile through the time series for each receptor.
     o  For the first subfile create non-linearity profiles for each
        receptor spanning the entire observation, then concatenates
        subsequent subfile profiles.
  -  Analyses the complete non-linearity profile of each good receptor
     in turn to identify anomalous spectra.
     o  Reduces the noise to obtain a smooth profile.
     o  Rejects spectra whose mean non-linearity exceeds the mean level
        a nominated number of clipped standard deviations (see Arguments
        EDGE_CLIP and THRESH_CLIP).  The derived standard deviation
        allows for positive skewness.
     o  For the first receptor, creates a file to store a mask of rejected
        spectra, then subsequently pastes the mask for other receptors.
  -  Forms a version of each subfile cube where the non-linear
     spectra are masked.
     o  Copies the current time-series cube to form a mask cube.
     o  Expand the receptor-time series masks into the original cube
        dimensions.
     o  Populate bad values in the mask cube at the location of any
        rejected spectrum.
     o  Applies the mask to the input cube.

It has the advantage of retaining good data for receptors that are only
occasionally bad, rather than rejecting all spectra for a receptor
as _MASK_BAD_BASELINE_* primitives do.

The advantage of using all the data in an observation is that a
representative statistics can be obtained and outliers detected.
Processing the subfiles independently could lead to an ambiguity
of the mean level if a say a short subfile has a significant fraction
of non-linear spectra.  If most spectra are non-linear the whole
receptor should be rejected by L<_MASK_BAD_BASELINE_LINEARITY_>.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item EDGE_CLIP = STRING (Given)

The standard deviation to clip iteratively the summed non-linearity
profile in order to measure the mean and standard deviation of the
profile unaffected by bad spectra.  A comma-separated list
will perform iterative sigma clipping of outliers, but standard
deviations in the list should not decrease.  This argument
can be overridden by the RECPAR_LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE_EDGE_CLIP
uhdr via the recipe parameter system.  ["2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0"]

=item LINEWIDTH = STRING (Given)

This specifies the location of spectral-line emission.  It can be
either "auto", which requests that the emission be found
automatically; or it is the extent(s) of the source spectral line(s)
measured in km/s, supplied in a comma-separated list.  For the latter
each range may be given as bounds separated by a colon; or as a single
value being the width about zero.  For instance "-20:50" would excise
the region -20 to +50 km/s, and "30" would exclude the -15 to +15 km/s
range. This argument can be overridden by the
RECPAR_BASELINE_LINEARITY_LINEWIDTH uhdr via the recipe parameter
system.  ["auto"]

=item MIN_SPECTRA = INTEGER (Given)

Minimum number of good spectra for non-linearity filtering to be attempted.
This argument can be overridden by the RECPAR_LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE_MIN_SPECTRA
uhdr via the recipe parameter system.  [50]

=item SCALELENGTH = INTEGER (Given)

The smoothing scale length in pixels.  Features narrower than this are
filtered out during the background-level determination.  It should be
should be odd (if an even value is supplied, the next higher odd value
will be used) and sufficiently large to remove the noise while not
removing the low-frequency patterns in the spectra. The minimum
allowed is 51.  This argument can be overridden by the
RECPAR_BASELINE_LINEARITY_SCALELENGTH uhdr via the recipe parameter
system.  [101]

=item THRESH_CLIP = REAL (Given)

The number of standard deviations at which to threshold the noise
profile above the mean level.  This argument can be overridden by
the RECPAR_LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE_THRESH_CLIP uhdr via the recipe
parameter system.  [4.0]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for ACSIS timeseries data in raster or grid
modes.

=item *

This primitive is suitable for spectral-line observations.

=item *

This primitive will not run if the LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE uhdr in the current
Frame object is defined and false.

=item *

The 85% trimming of the spectra is the same trim applied in the
QA primitives.

=item *

The primitive excludes analysis of the bad receptors, defaulting to
those listed in either the master (F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/index.bad_receptors>)
or the local index F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.bad_receptors_qa>).

=item *

If automatic emission detection is selected through LINEWIDTH the
one-dimensional spectral mask generated is tagged
APPROX_EMISSION_E<lt>iE<gt> for possible later reuse, where E<lt>iE<gt>
is the subsystem number.

=item *

It checks whether or not the internal header MERGED_HYBRID is set; if
it is defined then non-linearity tests are applied to the merged
spectra, otherwise the primitive performs the tests in each subband
independently.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

A cleaned version of the supplied time-series cube in which the noisy
spectra are set to bad.  It has the suffix _lfimasked (for Low
Frequency Interference).
