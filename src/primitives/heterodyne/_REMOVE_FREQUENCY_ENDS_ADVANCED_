=head1 NAME

_REMOVE_FREQUENCY_ENDS_ADVANCED_ - Intelligently find high-noise
regions at end of frequency bounds and remove them.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive first collapses the input cube along the time and
receptor axes using the COLLAPSE SIGMA estimator to form a single
spectrum, then fits a constant value background to the resulting
spectrum. The fitting regions are used to determine where the spectrum
gets noisier (i.e. higher RMS values in the RMS spectrum), and these
high-noise regions are trimmed from the ends in the frequency axis.

Hybrid mode observations have an additional check done to ensure that
too many channels are not trimmed.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item AXIS = INTEGER (Given)

The axis to trim. For time-series data this should be set to 1. For
spatial cubes this should be set to 3. [3]

=item LOWER = REAL (Given)

The percentage of the total frequency range to trim from the lower
end of the frequency range. For example, if a cube has 1024 frequency
channels, and the percentage to trim is 10%, then 102 channels will be
trimmed from the lower end. [undef]

=item MINIMUM_OVERLAP = INTEGER (Given)

The minimum number of desired channels that will overlap after doing
trimming for hybrid-mode observations. If the number of overlapping
channels is lower than this, then the fixed number of channels will be
trimmed according to the C<LOWER> and C<UPPER> arguments. [5]

=item PERCENT = REAL (Given)

The percentage of the total frequency range to trim from either
end. For example, if a cube has 1024 frequency channels, and the
percentage to trim is 10%, then 102 channels will be trimmed from
either end. [10.0]

=item UPPER = REAL (Given)

The percentage of the total frequency range to trim from the higher
end of the frequency range. For example, if a cube has 1024 frequency
channels, and the percentage to trim is 10%, then 102 channels will be
trimmed from the upper end. [undef]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for ACSIS time-series data.

=item *

The frequency axis is assumed to be the first axis of the input cube.

=item *

This primitive can only handle the case where there are two subbands
in the hybrid-mode observation.

=item *

If there are fewer than five pixels in either spatial axis, then the
_REMOVE_FREQUENCY_ENDS_ primitive is called to trim the noisy ends.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

filename.
