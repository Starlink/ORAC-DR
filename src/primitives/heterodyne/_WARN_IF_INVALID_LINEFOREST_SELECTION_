=head1 NAME

_WARN_IF_INVALID_LINEFOREST_SELECTION_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive issues a warning if the observer has selected the
line-forest recipe for an observation that is not a line forest.  Most
of the work is performed by _IS_OBSERVATION_A_LINEFOREST_ operating
on the Group file (or the middle-indexed file if there is more than
one Grp file).

The Group uhdr LINEFOREST_BASELINE should be set to 1 for this
primitive to operate.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The Group file should be a position-position-velocity cube.

# This observation group is ostensibly of a line forest based upon

# this recipe for non line-forest data.  Doing so can cause poor
# baseline fitting due to excessive aggressive masking in MFITTREND.
# Therefore validate the Group file if it's the sole one, or the
# central tile, which is most likely to contain the strongest
# signal.  Being the largest increases thre odd too.
