=head1 NAME

_MASK_FREQUENCY_ENDS_ - Remove the ends of a cube's frequency axis.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive removes the ends of a cube's frequency axis by copying
out a central portion of the cube to a new file. This primitive
differs from _MASK_FREQUENCY_ENDS_ in that this primitive does not
create a cube with masked-out bad pixels on either ends of the
frequency axis, whereas _MASK_FREQUENCY_ENDS_ does.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item PERCENT = REAL (Given)

The percentage of the total frequency range to trim from either
end. For example, if a cube has 1024 frequency channels, and the
percentage to trim is 10%, then 102 channels will be trimmed from
either end. [10.0]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

None.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

Cube with masked frequency ends, with the _em suffix appended to the
filename.
