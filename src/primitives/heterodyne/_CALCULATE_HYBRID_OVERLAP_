=head1 NAME

_CALCULATE_HYBRID_OVERLAP_ - Calculate size of overlap region for
hybrid-mode observations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive calculates the size of the overlap region for two files
in a hybrid-mode observation. It does so by doing a WCSALIGN in-situ,
then finding the upper and lower NDF bounds in the frequency axis for
each file.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item AXIS = INTEGER (Given)

Which axis is the frequency axis. [1]

=item FILE1 = STRING (Given)

The first filename to check overlap for.

=item FILE2 = STRING (Given)

The second filename to check overlap for.

=item LBOUND = INTEGER (Returned)

The lower bound of the overlap region.

=item UBOUND = INTEGER (Returned)

The upper bound of the overlap region.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

Both FILE1 and FILE2 arguments must be passed. If this is not the
case, an error will be thrown.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 TASKS

KAPPA: WCSALIGN.

=head1 REQUIRED PERL MODULES

None.
