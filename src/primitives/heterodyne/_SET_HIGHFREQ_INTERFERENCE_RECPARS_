=head1 NAME

_SET_HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_RECPARS_ - Obtains and reports the recipe parameters
that control rejection of spectra affected by high-frequency interference.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive obtains the recipe parameters associated with the
removal of transient high-frequency interference in psectea.  It
copies the values to internal headers for access by the relevant
primitives.  The primitive also reports the settings to the log in
yellow.

This primitive serves the heterodyne recipes' steering files in order
to avoid duplicated code.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item

The recipe parameters accessed by this primitive are:
HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE, HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_EDGE_CLIP,
HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_THRESH_CLIP, HIGHFREQ_RINGING, and
HIGHFREQ_RINGING_MIN_SPECTRA.  These should be added to the list of
parameters to verify with ORAC::Recipe::Parameters::verify_parameters
in the calling steering primitive.

=item

If HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE is set false, other HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_...
recipe parameters are ignored.  The assumed default is that there
will be filtering of high-frequency interence.

=item

The internal headers have names "RECPAR_" followed by the recipe
parameter name.

=item

The bad-baseline detections assume that the receptors supplied are
not full of bad values.  Therefore the primitive sets the boolean
internal header INDEX_BAD_RECEPTORS if bad baselines are being
hunted to ensure that an all-bad receptor is listed in the
bad_receptors index.
