=head1 NAME

_COLLAPSE_CENTRAL_LINE_ -- Collapse around the central line in a cube.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive collapses a baselined spectral cube along the spectral
axis between the two baseline regions.  The regions are the middle
pair numerically (rather than spectrally).  Historically, there would
have been but two baseline regions, one either side of a single
spectral line. Now there can be many baseline regions interspersed
between emision lines.  The middle pair may not be at the strongest or
most spectrally central line.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item AXIS = INTEGER (Given)

The axis to collapse over. [3]

=item ESTIMATOR = STRING (Given)

The method to use for estimating the output pixel values. This can be
any of those listed for the KAPPA:COLLAPSE task. ['integ']

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for heterodyne observations.

=item *

It uses the Frame's internal header BASELINE_REGIONS to determine the
non-baseline region.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The collapsed images with _integ suffix.
