=head1 NAME

_REMOVE_FLAT_FIELD_ITERATE_ - Remove flat-field effects iteratively.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive first evaluates the receptor-to-receptor responses of
one or more baselined time-series cubes.  Then it applies the relative
sensitivities to flat field those same cubes.  It segregates a group
of cubes by observation date, and derives a flat field for each date.
To derive the relative responses the primitive generates spectral
cubes for each receptor individually, then collapses each cube along
the frequency and time axes to form a composite spectrum for each
receptor.  Then it has a choice of methods to analyse them (see
Argument METHOD).

The first sums the flux over a velocity range for each individual
receptor (Curtis, Richer & Buckle 2009) integrating over all the
spectra.  This assumes that all receptors see the same flux which in
general will not be true, but in practice this does a decent job
provided the velocity range just spans the emission.  One case where
it didn't work so well is where there appeared to be non-linearity in
the data and the flat field for the bright parts seemed not to be the
same as near the background.

The second selects signal above the median plus four standard
deviations, particularly when there are multiple lines.  This offers
a simple means to exclude the noisy baseline and reduce the
uncertainty in the relative data values in each receptor.  It then
normalizes the flux in the receptors to the tracking receptor's flux.
It then uses this multiplicative factor to normalize the input
time-series data.  Since there are differences in the baselines and
relative signal between receptors, the thresholding introduces a bias.
This primitive employs an iterative method, first applying the initial
corrections, which raise or lower the mean spectrum of a receptor so
that the thresholding is more consistent with other receptors.  It
then recalculates the correction factors and folds these in with the
earlier factors.  The procedure stops after MAX_ITERATIONS iterations
or when convergence has been met, currently set at no more than 1 per
cent shift from the previous iteration.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item APPLY = BOOLEAN (Given)

Whether or not to apply the calculated flatfield.  If APPLY is false
the ratios are still calculated and logged.  This argument can be
overridden by the RECPAR_FLAT_APPLY uhdr via the recipe parameter
system. [1]

=item COMBINE_BY_DATE = BOOLEAN (Given)

When this is set true and GROUP is 2, the data are analysed by date,
combining all the observations on the same UT date to improve the
signal-to-noise in the flat field.  While this is generally a good
thing, if only to combine both directions of a weave, there are times
when the receptor-to-receptor performance changes during a night,
hence this argument to disable this behaviour.  [1]

=item FLAT_REGIONS = STRING (Given)

A comma-separated list of velocity ranges each in the format v1:v2,
from where the flat-field should be derived.  These should specify
regions of moderate to strong emission, but not just compact bright
sources.  See also the deprecated LOWER_VELOCITY and UPPER_VELOCITY
which may be used if this argument is undefind. This argument can be
overridden by the RECPAR_FLAT_REGIONS uhdr via the recipe-parameter
system.  If no velocity range is set then the whole spectral range is
used.  [undef]

=item GROUP = INTEGER (Given)

How to process group files. 0 means use the current Frame object. 1
means use the current Group object. 2 means use each Frame member of
the current Group object. [0]

=item LOWER_VELOCITY = REAL (Given)

The requested lower velocity for the flat-field estimations.
This argument can be overridden by the RECPAR_FLAT_REGIONS (or the
deprecated RECPAR_FLAT_LOWER_VELOCITY) uhdr via the recipe-parameter
system.  [undef]

=item MAX_ITERATIONS = INTEGER (Given)

The maximum number of iterations to seek convergence for METHOD set to
'itersum'.  This will be ignored (effectively set to 1) if the
METHOD is 'sum'.  [6]

=item METHOD = STRING (Given)

This selects the method used to derive the relative gains of the
receptors.  The allowed selection comprises 'sum' which finds the
integrated flux in a velocity window, or 'itersum' which uses
thresholiding to define the contributing signal.  This argument can be
overridden by the RECPAR_FLAT_METHOD uhdr via the recipe parameter
system.  ['sum']

=item REFERENCE_RECEPTOR = STRING (Given)

Which receptor is the reference receptor to which the others are
normalized.  The default comes from the REFRECEP header.  []

=item RESERVE_REFERENCE = STRING (Given)

A second receptor to be used when the reference receptor is defective, say
suffering from bad baselines.  ['H10']

=item UPPER_VELOCITY = REAL (Given)

The requested upper velocity for the flat-field estimations.
This argument can be overridden by the RECPAR_FLAT_REGIONS (or the
deprecated RECPAR_FLAT_UPPER_VELOCITY) uhdr via the recipe-parameter
system.  [undef]

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive should only be used when you can be assured that each
receptor has sampled approximately the same amount of flux across the
observation. Rasters of clouds are good candidates, jiggles or grids
are not.

=item *

This primitive is suitable for baselined time-series ACSIS cubes.

=item *

The cube is collapsed along the time and frequency axes using the
'sum' estimator.

=item *

Only applies to RASTER or SCAN types.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The flat-fielded time-series cube with suffix _ff.
