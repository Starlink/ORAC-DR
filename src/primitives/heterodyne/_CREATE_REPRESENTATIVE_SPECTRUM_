=head1 NAME

_CREATE_REPRESENTATIVE_SPECTRUM_ -- Create a representative spectrum
from a cube.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive creates a representative spectrum from a
cube. Currently, "representative spectrum" means a spectrum extracted
from the peak flux pixel in the integrated intensity map created from
the entire cube.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

None.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for ACSIS.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The representative spectrum with a suffix _rsp.
