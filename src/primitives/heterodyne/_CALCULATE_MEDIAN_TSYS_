=head1 NAME

_CALCULATE_MEDIAN_TSYS_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive calculates and stores the median system temperature (Tsys) 
at the centre of reduced ACSIS cubes, since MAKECUBE only does this for a subset
of cases including the less common case when the spreading method is nearest.

The formula relating the variance and Tsys is used.

Tsys = 0.5 * sqrt( variance * eff_time * delta_nu ) / backend_degradation

where variance comes from the VARIANCE component, eff_time from the SMURF
extension's EFF_TIME NDF, backend degradation factor from the BEDEGFAC
header.  The delta_nu is the pixel scale at the array centre in Hz in the
topocentric standard of rest, and it is scaled by a factor of 1.5 if the
FFT windowing header (FFT_WIN) is "hanning".

The primitive pastes the effective time and variance tiles, and finds their
median values, applies the formula to derived the median Tsys.

The object MEDTSYS header is updated with the calculated value and written
to the corresponding file's header.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=item GROUP = INTEGER (Given)

How to process group files. 0 means use the current Frame object. 1
means use the current Group object. 2 means use each Frame member of
the current Group object.  [1]

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The tiled variances in files with the _var suffix.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for ACSIS spectral-cube  data.

=item *

The median Tsys is written to each object's C<MEDTSYS> internal
header for later logging, and also to each tile NDF's FITS airlock
using the same keyword.

=item *

For tiled cubes of more than 400 Mpixel, the median is calculated 
by histograms rather than finding the true median by sorting.
