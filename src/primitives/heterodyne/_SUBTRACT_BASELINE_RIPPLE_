=head1 NAME

_SUBTRACT_BASELINE_RIPPLE_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive creates and subtracts a baseline-ripple spectrum.

The primitive obtains the modal spectrum of the time-series cubes in
the current Group, masks the specified reference lines, and
interpolates across them to allow for reference lines located where
there is varying emission.  The interpolated spectrum is subtracted
from the original modal spectrum to form a estimate of the reference
spectrum.  The estimated spectrum is expanded to the size and bounds
of each input time-series cube and subtracted from every spectrum
within that cube (so as to fill in the absorption lines).

This primitive is only implemented if the recipe parameters
SUBTRACT_REF_SPECTRUM is set true, and REF_SPECTRUM_REGIONS defines a
valid set of extents.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item EMISSION_CUT = FLOAT (Given)

system.  [0.01]

=item FWHM = INTEGER (Given)

The name of an NDF that contains a previoussly determined ripple
spectrum in.  An undefined value means that no file is to be subtracteed
to remove the baseline ripple.  Instead it is estimated from the
non-emission regions. [11]

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This primitive is suitable for UU data.

=item *

The output files, except the derived ripple spectrum, are logged as
Group intermediates for tidying, but would readily be available for
diagnostic purpose with ORAC_KEEP enables.  They are Group intermediates,
because the products combine data from different Frames.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

For each reference position or UT date (depending on the value of
Argument COMBINE_BY_REFPOS) there is a series of files generated.  They
all have the root name F<master_refspec>I<N> for the I<N>th sub-group.
The various files are as follows.

=over 4

=item *

The weighted mean of the aligned mean spectra within the sub-group
has suffix F<_amrs>.

=item *

The estimated reference spectrum when COMBINE_DETECTORS is false, or
the composite spectrum has the suffix F<_udrs> (user-defined reference
spectrum).

=item *

The reference spectrum expanded to the dimensions of the input data
cube has the suffix F<_tsc> (time-series cube).

=item *

The _tsc file aligned pixel for pixel with the imput time-series cube
has suffix F<_tscal>.

=back

=item *

Spectral cube data with the ripple spectrum subtracted having the
F<_sris> (subtract  ripple spectrum) suffix applied to each Frame of the current Group.

=item *

The input time-series data with the strongest spectra masked, having
the F<_mrsmask> suffix applied to each Frame of the Group.

=item *

The modal spectrum for each Frame having the F<_mrs> suffix.  It may
contain spectra for each receptor.

=item *

The weighted average of the subfile modal spectra, having the F<_wamrs>
suffix, for each observation.

=item *

The WCS-aligned weighted average of the subfile modal spectra, having
the F<_wamrsal> suffix, for each observation.
