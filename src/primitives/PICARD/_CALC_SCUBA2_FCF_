=head1 NAME

_CALC_SCUBA2_FCF_ - derive FCFs from input images of SCUBA-2 calibration sources

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CALC_SCUBA2_FCF_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This PICARD primitive is designed to calculate flux conversion factors
(FCFs) from images of SCUBA-2 calibration sources. These values are
stored in the C<PICARD_RESULTS> data if requested.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has one argument:

=over 4

=item B<LOGFILE>

A flag to denote whether to store information in the C<PICARD_RESULTS>
hash for later writing to a logfile. Overridden by the presence of the
C<RECPAR_LOGFILE> recipe parameter. Default is 1.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR primitives:

SCUBA2: _FIND_CALIBRATION_MAP_;
PICARD: _GET_CURRENT_RESULTS_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

FCFs are written to a log file C<log.fcf>. See
L<_ADD_FCF_LOG_ENTRY_|_ADD_FCF_LOG_ENTRY_> for details on the format.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None.
