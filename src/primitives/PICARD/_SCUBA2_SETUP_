=head1 NAME

_SCUBA2_SETUP_ - make SCUBA-2 infrastructure available to PICARD

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_SCUBA2_SETUP_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sets up a few useful user-header entries for dealing with SCUBA-2 data.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has no arguments.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA

NDFTRACE

=back

=head1 NOTES

Since the first file is used to set the current units, and downstream
decisions may be made based on those units, passing in a mix of
calibrated and uncalibrated data is likely to lead to strange results
and is not recommended.
