=head1 NAME

_MOSAIC_JCMT_IMAGES_ - combine JCMT images taking NDF components into account

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_MOSAIC_JCMT_IMAGES_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This PICARD primitive is designed to combine multiple SCUBA-2 or ACSIS
images, taking into account the existence of the EXP_TIME and WEIGHTS
NDF components.

The mosaicking step can be performed by KAPPA/wcsmosaic or
CCDPACK/makemos (not yet implemented).

All the input images must be of the same source and they must be
aligned to the same grid for the EXP_TIME sum to work correctly.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive supports the following arguments:

=over 4

=item B<METHOD>

Pixel-spreading scheme. Default is C<NEAREST> for nearest-neighbour.

=item B<TASK>

Task to perform the mosaicking step. May be C<wcsmosaic> or
C<makemos>. Default is C<wcsmosaic>.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA

WCSMOSAIC

=item ORAC-DR primitives:

SCUBA2: _ADD_IMAGES_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates a single output file with the suffix C<_mos>

=head1 NOTES

Processing is delayed until the last Frame in the Group is
reached. Care should be taken that any downstream primitives are aware
of this.

Only KAPPA/wcsmosaic supported at the moment.

Does not handle multiple sources (will try and mosaic them all!).

Has not been tested on ACSIS data.

The output EXP_TIME is created via a simple sum of pixel values so all
the input images should be created on the same grid.
