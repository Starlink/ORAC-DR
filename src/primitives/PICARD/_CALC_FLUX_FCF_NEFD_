=head1 NAME

_CALC_FLUXNOISE_ - calculate the flux of a source

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CALC_FLUXNOISE_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This PICARD primitive is designed to calculate fluxes, noise levels
and FCFs by aperture photometry from images of SCUBA-2 calibration
sources. NEFDs are also calculated

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has no arguments.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR primitives:

SCUBA2: _FIND_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY_, _GET_PIXEL_SCALE_,
_REMOVE_BACKGROUND_FROM_IMAGE_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates files with suffix C<_back> for all input files.

Creates a log file called C<log.fluxnoise>.
