=head1 NAME

_JCMT_PICARD_RESULTS_ - store basic observation info in hash

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_JCMT_PICARD_RESULTS_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This PICARD primitive stores a hash reference containing details of
the current file, such as name, source and wavelength.

The stored hash is used and re-stored in subsequent primitives, and
the values are available for writing to a log file once processing is
complete.

Note that if the hash already exists, this primitive will overwrite
it.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has no arguments.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

No external tasks are used.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The uhdr entry C<PICARD_RESULTS> contains a hash reference. The hash
contains the following keys:

=over 4

=item * airmass

Mean airmass for current file.

=item * file

Name of input file.

=item * freq

Frequency in GHz

=item * obsnum

Observation number.

=item * source

Source name.

=item * tau

Mean optical depth at 225 GHz for current file.

=item * wavelen

Wavelength in um.

=item * wvm

Mean WVM tau for current file.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None
