=head1 NAME

_FIND_BEAM_SIZE_ - Calculate the beam size from a calibrator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_FIND_BEAM_SIZE_ GAUSSIAN=1 METHOD=PSF

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive carries out a fit to a calibrator (or pointing target)
to determine the beam size and position angle using one of two
available methods. The reported values are the
full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) along the major and minor axes, and
the beam position angle on the sky at the time of obseration. The fit
is performed in the SKY domain so the FWHM is returned in arcsec.

The default is to allow the current fitting routine to determine the
shape of the beam. A flag may be specified to force the return of the
equivalent gaussian beam parameters.

The fit is carried out on the current Group image or the current
co-added Frame and will fail if there is more than one file in the
Frame.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<GAUSSIAN>

A flag to indicate whether the fit is forced to be Gaussian. The
default is 1 (yes).

=item B<GROUP>

Flag to indicate whether the primitive is to process the Group
image. Default is 0 (false), which will use the current stacked Frame
image.

=item B<LOGFILE>

A flag to indicate whether a pipeline log file should be written
containing the results of the fit. Default is 1 (true).

=item B<METHOD>

Method for deriving the beam parameters. Valid options are C<BEAMFIT>
or C<PSF>. Default is C<BEAMFIT>. In practice, anything other than
C<PSF> will implies C<BEAMFIT>.

=item B<OBSEND>

Flag to indicate whether the primitive should wait until the
observation has ended before fitting the beam. The default is 1
(wait until end).

=item B<OFFSET>

A flag to denote whether to return the centroid in offset
coordinates. A value of 1 will force the primitive to set the SkyRefIs
attribute to C<Origin> if it has not already been set. Default is 0
(false) which will use the current value.

=item B<SYSTEM>

Coordinate system in which to perform the fit. The default is
C<AZEL>. May be C<AZEL>, C<ICRS>, C<FK5>, C<GAPPT> or
C<GALACTIC>. Minimum match is supported.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to indicate whether informational messages should be given to the
user. Default is 1 (print messages).

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES:

_ASSESS_BEAM_FIT_, _ASSESS_IMAGE_, _CENTROID_IMAGE_, _FIT_SOURCE_

=head1 NOTES

This method only fits a single component to the beam. This is not
enough at 450 microns, but currently the beam is not sufficiently
well-known to do much more.

Using coordinate frames other than AzEl will cause the beam to appear
to rotate during the course of an observation.

Not all pointing targets are point-like so results from these objects
should be assessed in light of what is known about the extent of the
emission associated with these sources.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The beam parameters are stored in the calibration system.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

If requested, the beam parameters are written to the log file
C<log.beam>.

=head1 LOGFILE FORMAT

The logfile has the following columns:

=over 4

=item UT

The UT date in C<YYYYMMDD.frac> format.

=item HST

The time of the observation in Hawaii.

=item Obs

The observation number.

=item Source

The source name.

=item Mode

The observing mode.

=item Filter

The filter associated with the current result.

=item Elevation

The elevation of the observation.

=item CSO

Equivalent CSO tau derived from the tau used to reduce
the observation.

=item Tau

The tau value used for the reduction.

=item Seeing

The seeing value as stored in the header.

=item A

Beam semi-major axis in arcsec.

=item dA

Error in A.

=item B

Beam semi-minor axis in arcsec.

=item dB

Error in B.

=item PA

Position of major axis, in degrees east of north.

=item dPA

Error in PA.

=item Errbeam

Fractional contribution of error beam (per cent).
