_SCAN_TIDY_ - clean up and delete files at the end of processing SCAN data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_SCAN_TIDY_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Clean up after processing SCAN data by deleting files which are no
longer needed. The only files kept on disk are calibrated data and, if
no new image was created on this pass through the recipe, flatfielded
data. All other intermediate files are deleted including those in the
current group object.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has the following argument:

=over 4

=item KEEP

A list of file suffices to keep at the end of the recipe. The default
includes C<_flat> and C<_reduced>. Customized recipes may need
specific files left on disk.
