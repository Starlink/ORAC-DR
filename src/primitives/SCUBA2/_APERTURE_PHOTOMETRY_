=head1 NAME

_APERTURE_PHOTOMETRY_ - perform aperture photometry on a source

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _APERTURE_PHOTOMETRY_

 _APERTURE_PHOTOMETRY_ IMAGE=$Grp->file RADIUS=30

 _APERTURE_PHOTOMETRY_ RADIUS=30 INNER=1.5 OUTER=2.5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Aperture photometry of a point source.

A sky annulus is defined in terms of multiples of the aperture
radius. The default is to use an annulus bounded by 1.25 and 2
aperture radii. The user should take care to ensure the image is large
enough to encompass the sky annulus.

Currently it is assumed that the source lies close to (0,0) in pixel
coordinates, though the photometry task calculates the centroid
position and centres the aperture at that position.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<GROUP>

A flag to denote whether to use the current Group or Frame file. Only
accessed if B<IMAGE> is not defined. Default is 0 (use the Frame
file).

=item B<IMAGE>

Name of an image to perform aperture photometry. Default depends on
choice of the B<GROUP> parameter.

=item B<INNER>

Inner scale factor for annulus in units of the aperture radius.
Should be >1. Default is 1.25. May be overridden with the recipe
parameter C<AUTOPHOTOM_INNER>.

=item B<OUTER>

Outer scale factor for annulus in units of the aperture radius. Should
be greater than B<INNER>. Default is 2.0. May be overridden with the
recipe parameter C<AUTOPHOTOM_OUTER>.

=item B<RADIUS>

Radius of aperture in arcsec. Default is 20 arcsec.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to print additional messages to screen. Default
is 0 (no).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item PHOTOM

AUTOPHOTOM

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES:

_GET_PIXEL_SCALE_

=back

=head1 NOTES

The image size should be at least twice the aperture radius (or
2*B<OUTER>) but this is currently not verified here.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The following entries are returned in the primitive hash
C<%_APERTURE_PHOTOMETRY_>:

=over 4

=item * TOTALFLUX

Total signal integrated over the aperture in units of signal * arcsec**2.

=item * SUM

Total signal within the aperture in units of the original signal.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None.
