=head1 NAME

_REMOVE_PLANE_FROM_TIMESERIES_ -  remove a plane from time-series data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _REMOVE_PLANE_FROM_TIMESERIES_ FIT=PLANE RELATED=1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive fits a 2-d plane to the bolometer data at each time in
time-series data. The user can control the type of fit through the
B<FIT> and B<RELATED> parameters. See the SMURF C<REMSKY>
documentation for full details. Operates on all files in the current
Frame object.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<FIT>

Options are subtract a mean value (MEAN), or to fit a 2-D plane in
elevation only (ELEV) or an arbitrary plane (PLANE). Default is
MEAN. ELEV is slowest.

=item B<RELATED>

A flag to denote whether to group related files and fit across all
subarrays at a given sample. Default is 0 (do not group related files).

=item B<VERBOSE>

A flag to denote whether to report more messages. Default is 1 (yes).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item SMURF:

REMSKY

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

Sets the C<SKY_SUBTRACTION> Frame uhdr entry to 1 if successful.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates output files with the suffix C<_sky>. The Frame is updated
with the new files.

=head1 NOTES

Does not return or log the subtracted sky values.

No action is taken if the C<SKY_SUBTRACTION> flag is set in the Frame
uhdr.
