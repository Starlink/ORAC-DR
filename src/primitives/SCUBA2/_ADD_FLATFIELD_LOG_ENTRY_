=head1 NAME

_ADD_FLATFIELD_LOG_ENTRY_ - Write flatfield log entry to disk

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_ADD_FLATFIELD_LOG_ENTRY_ PARAMS=$paramsref

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Write entry to a log file given properties of the responsivities for
the current flatfield solution.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<PARAMS>

Array reference with list of parameters. It is the user's
responsibility to ensure that the array contains the appropriate
values.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES:

_GET_LOG_PARAMETERS_

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

One entry is written each time this primitive is called. If multiple
files are to be processed, this primitive should be called multiple
times.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates an output log file called C<log.noise>

=head1 LOGFILE FORMAT

The logfile has the following columns:

=over 4

=item UT

The UT date in C<YYYYMMDD.frac> format.

=item HST

The time of the observation in Hawaii.

=item Obs

The observation number.

=item Subarray

Current subarray

=item Median

Median responsivity

=item Delta

Change in median

=item Mean

Mean responsivity

=item Delta

Change in mean

=item Sigma

Standard deviation of responsivity values

=item Delta

Change in sigma

=item Max

Maximum responsivity

=item Delta

Change in maximum

=item Min

Minimum responsivity

=item Delta

Change in minimum

=item Ngood

Number of good solutions

=item Delta

Change in the number of good solutions

=back
