=head1 NAME

_CROP_IMAGE_ - Trim image to a desired size

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _CROP_IMAGE_

 _CROP_IMAGE_ IN=$infile

 _CROP_IMAGE_ WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=400

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive may be used to trim an image to a desired size. The
default behaviour is to use the map parameters defined in the Frame
header to define the size of the cropped image. The user may override
the map width and height using the parameters described below.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<HEIGHT>

New map height in arcsec. If not specified, the map height in the
header will be used.

=item B<IMAGE>

Name of input file. The primitive will use the current Frame file if
not specified.

=item B<WIDTH>

New map width in arcsec. If not specified, the map width in the header
will be used.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_MASK_AST_REGION_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Produces output files with the suffix C<_crop>.

=head1 NOTES

This primitive should be used on Frame objects only.

It is up to the user to register the output file with the Frame.

This primitive will trim all NDFs within a file including, e.g., the
EXP_TIME and WEIGHTS components of SCUBA-2 images. There is no need to
treat these separately.
