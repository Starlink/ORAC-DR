=head1 NAME

_SUMMIT_STEER_ - steering primitive for the Summit pipeline

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_SUMMIT_STEER_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive tells the pipeline to ignore SCAN data which will not
be processed into an image. Once a new Group image has been created,
all subsequent Frames are marked as not good so the pipeline does not
attempt to mosaic processed and unprocessed data. A flag is set so
that the ignored data are not calibrated.
                                                                                
This primitive should ONLY be called in summit recipes (denoted by
the C<_SUMMIT> suffix).

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The current Frame is set to bad.

The uhdr entry C<NOCALIB> is set to 1 to ensure the pipeline will not
attempt to calibrated the data.
