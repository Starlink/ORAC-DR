=head1 NAME

_PLOT_FIT_PROFILE_ - plot X and Y slices through an image along with fit

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _PLOT_FIT_PROFILE_ IMAGE=$data MODEL=$fit

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plots X- and Y-slices for a given image along with the 2-d fit. The
profiles are plotted as a function of arcsec side by side in a Kapview
window.

However, when called as part of calculating flux conversion factors,
four panels are plotted. The Frame uhdr entries C<PLOT_DATAFIT> and
C<PLOT_MF_FIT> are used to determine whether the data should be
plotted side-by-side on the top row (for map data) or the bottom row
(matched-filtered map data). Note that only two panels are plotted
when this primitive is called: the complete display requires two
calls.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 2

=item B<IMAGE>

Name of image to plot. No default. The pipeline will terminate with an
error if not specified.

=item B<MODEL>

Name of fitted model to plot. No default. The pipeline will terminate
with an error if not specified.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to indicate whether informational messages should be given to the
user. Default is 1 (true).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 2

=item KAPPA:

NDFCOPY, NDFTRACE, SETTITLE, WCSATTRIB

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_FIND_IMAGE_STATISTICS_

=back

=head1 NOTES

Input data must have at least 2 dimensions. It is assumed that the
first two dimensions are the X and Y axes respectively.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates files with suffix C<_sourcefit> and C<_sourcefit_model> which
are pushed onto the Frame intermediates array for deletion at the end
of the recipe.
