=head1 NAME

_CREATE_IMAGE_FRAME_ - generic primitive to create a Frame image

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CREATE_IMAGE_FRAME_ METHOD=LINEAR GENVAR=0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A basic generic primitive to deal with SCAN and DREAM/STARE image
creation designed to be used by non-science recipes, usually in QL
mode. Calls other primitives specific to the current
observing-mode. However, not all arguments to those primitives are
supported.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<GENVAR>

A flag to denote whether to generate variances. Default depends on the
presence of the C<QUICKLOOK> uhdr entry. For SCAN observations the
default is 1 (generate variances); for DREAM/STARE the default is 0.

=item B<METHOD>

The map-making method to be used by C<makemap>. May be C<ITERATE> or
C<REBIN>. Default is C<ITERATE>. If called as part of a quick-look
recipe, B<METHOD> is set to C<QL> and qlmakemap is used.

=item B<SPREAD>

Pixel-spreading scheme for the image-making process. Default is
C<NEAREST>.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_MAKE_MOSAIC_FRAME_, _MAKEMAP_FRAME_, _QLMAKEMAP_FRAME_

=back

=head1 NOTES

This primitive only supports the most useful arguments to the other
primitives and should only be used where the default values are good
enough.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

For SCAN data, the Frame uhdr entries C<SKY_SUBTRACTION> and
C<EXTINCTION> will be defined.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

See the documentation on the primitives used.
