=head1 NAME

_ADD_IMAGES_ - Add together a series of NDFs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _ADD_IMAGES_ IN=$imagelistref OUT=$out

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive uses KAPPA C<MSTATS> to add up a list of images. The
user specifies the names of one or more NDFs (assumed to be located
under the .MORE.SMURF.COMP hierarchy). This is useful for calculating
the total exposure time and weights for a series of images which are
mosaicked together. Note that the sum is carried out on a
pixel-for-pixel basis so the images must be aligned to a common
coordinate system before calling this primitive. Nothing is done if
the chosen component(s) do not exist (indicated by the presence of an
appropriate Frame uhdr entry).

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item B<INLIST>

Reference to array of image names. No default.

=item B<OUT>

Name of output file. No default.

=item B<COMPS>

Comma-separated list of NDF components to add. Default is the
C<EXP_TIME> and C<WEIGHTS> components under the C<.MORE.SMURF>
extension.
