=head1 NAME

_CREATE_NEP_IMAGE_GROUP_ - calculate an effective NEP image for each subarray

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CREATE_NEP_IMAGE_GROUP_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive creates images of the effective NEP as a function of
the pixel heater and detector bias settings for all Frame objects in
the current Grp. The Grp is sorted into sub-groups based on the
frequency range over which the noise was calculated.

The Frame objects must contain the results of a noise calculation.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following argument is supported:

=over 4

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to display extra information. Default is 0
(no).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_CREATE_NEP_IMAGE_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The Group contains the NEP images on exit.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

One file per subarray with the effective NEP as a function of the
heater and bias settings.
