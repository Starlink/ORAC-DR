=head1 NAME

_CALCULATE_NOISE_ - calculate a white noise image for each subarray

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CALCULATE_NOISE_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive calculates a noise image for each subarray. The noise
calculation should proceed differently depending on which pipeline is
being used. Usually, Frames which are only composed of darks are
ignored unless the observation is a Noise-Dark. If called from the
SUMMIT pipeline processing is deferred until the observation has
ended.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=item B<FREQHI>

Comma-separated pair of numbers indicating the frequency range (Hz)
over which to measure white noise portion of power spectrum. Default
is 2,10 (i.e. 2-10 Hz).

=item B<FREQLO>

Lower frequency at which to measure power spectrum. Default is 0.5 Hz.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to display extra information. Default is 0
(no).

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The current Frame object is updated with the output noise files.

The Frame uhdr is updated to set an entry called C<NOISE> which is 1
if noise images were calculated, otherwise 0.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

A noise file is created for each subarray with the suffix C<_noi>
