=head1 NAME

_CREATE_BAD_BOLO_MASK_ - Create a bad bolometer mask

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _CREATE_BAD_BOLO_MASK_ MASKVAL=10.0

 _CREATE_BAD_BOLO_MASK_ MASKVAL=10.0 FREQLO=0.1 FREQHI=5,10

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive creates a bad bolometer mask based on the power
spectrum of raw time series data.

The method involves calculating the ratio of power at two
user-specified frequencies. In practice, the high-frequency point is
the average over a range of frequencies expected to lie in the white
noise part of the spectrum. The low-frequency point should lie
somewhere in the 1/f regime. The relative power at the two frequencies
yields an estimate of contribution of the 1/f portion of the
spectrum. Out-of-spec bolometers are defined as those having more
power at low frequencies (hence less stable) and will be set to a
C<BAD> value in the output mask.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<BIN>

Number of samples to bin together to measure the power spectrum at
the lower frequency. Default is 1 (i.e. no binning).

=item B<FREQHI>

Comma-separated pair of numbers indicating the frequency range (Hz) to
measure white noise portion of power spectrum. Default is 2,10
(i.e. 2-10 Hz).

=item B<FREQLO>

Lower frequency to measure power spectrum. Default is 0.1 Hz.

=item B<MASKVAL>

Ratio of low-frequency to white noise power below which a bolometer is
deemed to be not operating within spec. Default is 10.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to display extra information. Default is 0
(no).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA: 

COLLAPSE, DIV, NDFCOPY, NDFTRACE, THRESH

=back

=head1 NOTES

This primitive must be run on power spectra or otherwise
Fourier-transformed data only.

No bad-bolometer mask will be generated if the frequencies do not lie
within range.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The Frame is updated to contain the white noise images on completion.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates an output file for each subarray present with suffix C<_bpm>,
which is stored in the calibration system.

Creates a white noise image for each subarray with suffix C<_noi>.
