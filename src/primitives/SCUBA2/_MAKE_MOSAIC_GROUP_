=head1 NAME

_MAKE_MOSAIC_GROUP_ - Create group mosaic

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _MAKE_MOSAIC_GROUP_  COADD_MODE=RUNNING

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes all the aligned sub-scan frames from each
sub-array or aligned frame mosaics and mosaics them into a single
coadded output group image.

Does not require the use of _MAKE_MOSAIC_FRAME_. This primitive
supports the -batch command line option.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item B<COADD_MODE>

Controls the coadding mode for the primitive. If COADD_MODE=RUNNING,
the new frames are combined with the existing group image. If
COADD_MODE=STACKALL the group image is recreated from all the constituent
frames each time it is called. Default mode is 'STACKALL'.

=back

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

Assumes the _ALIGN_ARRAYS_ primitive has been run on the input images.

Some issues with the determination of group file name.

=head1 ALGORITHMS

Usess CCDPACK MAKEMOS.

=head1 FILE SUFFIX

Creates a single output group image with a suffix of '_mos'.
