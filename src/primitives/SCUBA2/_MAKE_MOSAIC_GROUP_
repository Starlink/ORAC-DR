=head1 NAME

_MAKE_MOSAIC_GROUP_ - Create group mosaic

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_MAKE_MOSAIC_GROUP_  COADD_MODE=RUNNING

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive creates a new Group mosaic from the newest Frame
image(s). The input images may be combined in one of two ways, using
the B<COADD_MODE> parameter, depending on processing time
constraints. The quickest way is to simply mosaic the current Frame
and Group images together (C<RUNNING>). Output variances from this
method rely entirely on the presence of input variances. The other
method (C<STACKALL>) is to ignore any existing Group image (though it
may still be used as a reference image) and combine all of the
available Frame images to create a new Group mosaic. Output variances
may be derived from input variances or using the contributions to the
output pixels.

A half-way house option (C<DESPIKE>) exists which allows processing to
be delayed until a sufficient number of Frame images exist to permit a
reasonable variance to be estimated assuming the input Frame images
have no internal variances. This method also deals with the presence
of spikes and/or outlying values. See the C<COADD_MODE> parameter
below for full details.

The mosaicking task may be specified using the B<MAKEMOS> parameter
below.

The user may also specify that all processing should wait until the
current observation is complete. This is relevant only for running the
pipeline at the telescope.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<COADD_MODE>

Controls the coadding mode for the primitive. If C<RUNNING>, the new
frames are combined with the existing group image. If C<STACKALL> the
group image is recreated from all the constituent Frames each time it
is called. If C<DESPIKE> then the mosaicking task is set to MAKEMOS
and the parameter B<NMOS> must be specified. Default mode is
C<STACKALL>. Passed to _MAKE_MOSAIC_.

=item B<MAKEMOS>

A flag to denote whether to use CCDPACK MAKEMOS for mosaicking the
images. Default is 0 (no), which uses KAPPA WCSMOSAIC instead. Passed
directly to _MAKE_MOSAIC_.

=item B<MAKEMOS_METHOD>

The method by which MAKEMOS combines the images. Default is
C<mean>. See the MAKEMOS documentation for a description of the
possible values. Passed directly to _MAKE_MOSAIC_.

=item B<METHOD>

The method to be used for resampling the aligned images. This
corresponds to the C<method> parameter for WCSMOSAIC and WCSALIGN,
which is different from that for MAKEMOS. See WCSALIGN and/or
WCSMOSAIC documentation for further details. Default value is
C<nearest>. Passed directly to _MAKE_MOSAIC_.

=item B<NMOS>

Number of Frame images to mosaic together before coadding to
Group. Only used if B<COADD_MODE> is DESPIKE or for DREAM/STARE data
being processed by the quick-look pipeline. Default is 10. Passed
directly to _MAKE_MOSAIC_.

=item B<SIGMAS>

If B<MAKEMOS_METHOD> is C<sigma>, then this is the number of standard
deviations at which to clip the data before combining. Default is 4.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to display extra information. Default is 0
(no). Passed directly to _MAKE_MOSAIC_.

=item B<WAIT>

Flag to denote whether to wait until the current observation has ended
before processing the data. Only relevant for online processing at the
telescope. Default is 0 (no).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_MAKE_MOSAIC, _MAKE_MOSAIC_GROUP_DESPIKE_

=back

=head1 NOTES

It is assumed that all of the input images are aligned to the same
coordinate frame.

Defining the output filename for the Group mosaic is a bit of a hack.

For the DREAM/STARE quick-look pipeline _MAKE_MOSAIC_GROUP_DESPIKE_
is called as it is optimized for that use.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

On exit, the Group uhdr contains the entry NEWIMAGE which is set to 1
if a new Group file was created.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates a single output Group image with a suffix of C<_mos>.
