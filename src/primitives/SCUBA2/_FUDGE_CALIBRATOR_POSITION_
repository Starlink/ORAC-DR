=head1 NAME

_FUDGE_CALIBRATOR_POSITION_ - insert pointing offsets to fix positions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive only applies if the target object is a known calibration
source.  If it is, then L<_MAKEMAP_FRAME_|_MAKEMAP_FRAME_> is called
to make a map of it.  The pointing offsets are then retrieved
from its primitive hash and written into the uhdr.  The reason for
doing this is that, with SCUBA-2, calibrators may be observed prior to
a pointing being performed.  Multiple maps of calibrators can thus
only be co-added if they are corrected for pointing.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The pointing offsets are written into the uhdr entries
B<POINTING_OFFSET_X> and B<POINTING_OFFSET_Y>.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

The original input files are tagged before this primitive
begins processing and restored at the end.
