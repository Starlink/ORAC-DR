=head1 NAME

_MAKE_MOSAIC_FRAME_ - Create frame mosaic

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_MAKE_MOSAIC_FRAME_ MAKEMOS=1 METHOD=MEAN GENVAR=0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive is used for mosaicking files in the current Frame
object. See the documentation for L<_MAKE_MOSAIC_|_MAKE_MOSAIC_> for
further details on the parameters below.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported, some of which (as noted) are
passed directly to _MAKE_MOSAIC_:

=over 4

=item B<GENVAR>

Flag to determine whether or not to generate variances when
mosaicking. Default is 1 (yes). Passed directly to _MAKE_MOSAIC_.

=item B<MAKEMOS>

A flag to denote whether to use CCDPACK MAKEMOS for mosaicking the
images. Default is 0 (no), which uses KAPPA WCSMOSAIC instead. Passed
directly to _MAKE_MOSAIC_.

=item B<MAKEMOS_METHOD>

The method by which MAKEMOS combines the images. Default is
C<mean>. See the MAKEMOS documentation for a description of the
possible values. Passed directly to _MAKE_MOSAIC_.

=item B<METHOD>

The method to be used for resampling the aligned images. This
corresponds to the C<method> parameter for WCSMOSAIC and WCSALIGN,
which is different from that for MAKEMOS. See the documentation for
WCSALIGN and WCSMOSAIC for further details. Default value is
C<bilinear>. Passed directly to _MAKE_MOSAIC_.

=item B<SKYREF>

Flag to indicate whether to align images in a SKY coordinate
frame. Default is 1 (yes). Passed directly to _MAKE_MOSAIC_.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to display extra information. Default is 0
(no). Passed directly to _MAKE_MOSAIC_.

=item B<WAIT>

Flag to denote whether to wait until the current observation has ended
before processing the data. Only relevant for online processing at the
telescope. Default is 0 (no).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_MAKE_MOSAIC_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates a single output image with a suffix of C<_fmos>.
