=head1 NAME

_MAKE_MOSAIC_FRAME_ - Create frame mosaic

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _MAKE_MOSAIC_FRAME_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes all the aligned sub-frames and mosaics them into
a single output image. A check is made to see if the number of files
to mosaic is greater than the maximum allowed (a value which depends
on the version of CCDPACK installed), and if so the process is divided
into several steps to generate intermediate mosaicked files which are
then mosaicked at the end.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item METHOD

The method to be used to combine the images. In principle could be any
value supported by MAKEMOS (see MAKEMOS documentation for further
details). Currently, only MEAN or MEDIAN are supported. MEDIAN is the
default.

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

Assumes the _ALIGN_ARRAYS_ primitive has been run on the input
images. The check for the number of files to mosaic ($maxmos) is done
only once, which means this primitive will fail if the number of steps
exceeds the maximum number of files. Thus the effective limit to the
number of files to mosaic is $maxmos**2.

=head1 ALGORITHMS

Uses CCDPACK MAKEMOS. This primitive is currently a very general
implementation.

=head1 FILE SUFFIX

Creates a single output image with a suffix of '_mos'.
