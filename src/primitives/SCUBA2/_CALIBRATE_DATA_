=head1 NAME

_CALIBRATE_DATA_ - Multiply data by the flux conversion factor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _CALIBRATE_DATA_ UNITS=BEAM
 _CALIBRATE_DATA_ UNITS=ARCSEC

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Multiply SCUBA-2 data by the flux conversion factor (FCF).  The value
for the FCF depends on the filter and the type of calibration
required. The calibration units are specified by an argument.

Whilst this primitive can be run on a group, care must be taken that
it is not run multiple times on a group image.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<GROUP>

If true, the Group file will be calibrated. 

=item B<UNITS>

Controls the units of the FCF. The options are C<BEAM> for Jy/beam/pW
and C<ARCSEC> for Jy/arcsec**2/pW. Default is C<BEAM>.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA:

CMULT, SETUNITS

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES:

_GET_PIXEL_SCALE_

=back

=head1 NOTES

No attempt is made to determine whether the calibration has already
been applied to a Group file.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates an output file with a C<_cal> extension.
