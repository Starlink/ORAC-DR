=head1 NAME

_PIXDUPE_AND_SHIFT_ - Regrid an image with a smaller pixel size

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive regrids an image onto a grid with a smaller pixel scale
using the KAPPA C<PIXDUPE> command and then apply a fractional pixel
shift using AST. It is designed for use with SCUBA-2 observing in
STARE mode to take account of the undersampling at 450 um.

The user supplies the image name (no default). Optional parameters are
the expansion factor by which the pixels are reduced and the (x,y)
pixel shift. The `extra' pixels generated by the duplication are
blanked to allow offset images to be mosaicked.

The default value for the expansion factor is 2, and the default shift
is (-0.5,-0.5) pixels. These probably should not be changed.

When pixdupe creates the new image, the centre coordinates of the
original pixel remains unchanged. However, for the SCUBA-2 450-um
STARE data, we actually want to attach those coordinates to the bottom
single unblanked pixel; hence the need for the shift.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<FACTOR>

The factor by which the pixel scale should be reduced. Default value
is 2.

=item B<IMAGE>

Name of the image to be regridded. No default.

=item B<SHIFT>

A scalar or an array with the magnitude of the shift in pixels. A
negative shift indicates a shift to the East or South. If a single
value (scalar) is given then the shift is assumed to be the same in
both the X and Y directions.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to indicate whether informational messages should be given to the
user. Default is 1 (yes).
