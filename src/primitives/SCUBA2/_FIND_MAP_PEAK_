=head1 NAME

_FIND_MAP_PEAK_ - Determine the peak signal of a point source

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Finds the peak signal of a point source located at the map origin.
No attempt is made to search for sources not located at approximately
the map centre.

The peak signal is determined by fitting a 2-D Gaussian function.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<GROUP>

If true, the group file is used rather than the frame file.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to indicate whether informational messages should be given to the
user. Default is verbose (true).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA:

STATS

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES:

_CENTROID_IMAGE_, _FIND_BEAM_SIZE_

=back

=head1 NOTES

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

On completion, the primitive hash C<%_FIND_MAP_PEAK_>
contains the following keys:

=over 4

=item PEAK

The peak signal. Contains C<undef> if the calculation did not
complete sucessfully.

=item POSITION

The position of the peak. Reference to an array of x, y coordinates in
the current coordinate frame.

=back

The Frame object is not updated.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None.
