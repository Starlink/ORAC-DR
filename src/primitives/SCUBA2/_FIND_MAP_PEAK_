=head1 NAME

_FIND_MAP_PEAK_ - Determine the peak signal of a point source

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Finds the peak signal of a point source located at the map origin.
No attempt is made to search for sources not located at approximately
the map centre.

The peak signal is determined by fitting a gamma function.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item VERBOSE

Flat to indicate whether informational messages should be 
given to the user. Default is verbose (true).

=item GROUP

If true, the group file is used rather than the frame file.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

=over 4

=item KAPPA

PSF, WCSFRAME

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

On completion, the primitive hash C<%_FIND_MAP_PEAK_>
contains the following keys:

=over 4

=item PEAK

The peak signal. Contains C<undef> if the calculation did not
complete sucessfully.

=item POSITION

The position of the peak. Reference to an array of x, y coordinates.

=item PSF

If the PSF fit was successful the PSF fit parameters are available
as a reference to a hash in this parameters for _FIND_MAP_PEAK_.
This allows the fit results to be obtained without an additional
call to _FIT_PSF_ and also allows the programmer to know whether
the fit was successful.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

The following files are created:

=over 4

=item C<log.peak>

Log of peak signals.

=back

The frame object is not updated.
