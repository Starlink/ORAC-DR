=head1 NAME

_ALIGN_ARRAYS_ - Align all frames to a reference image

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _ALIGN_ARRAYS_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes all the sub-scan frames from each sub-array and
regrids them to a reference RA/Dec frame. By default this primitive
operatres on files within the current Frm, but this can be
over-ridden by supplying an optional Frm object.

If a group file exists, that is used as the reference, else the
current reference image in the Cal object, or finally the first frame
is chosen as reference if neither of those exist.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item METHOD

Keyword specifying the method for determing how the output pixels are
populated. The default is nearest-neighbour resampling
(C<nearest>). See the documentation for WCSMOSAIC or WCSALIGN for
further details. The recommended choices are C<nearest>, C<bilinear>,
or C<sincsinc>.

=item REBIN

A flag to determine whether to rebin or resample. Default is 0
(resample). See the WCSALIGN documentation for further information.

=item REF

The name of the reference image to use for alignment in the SKY
domain. If left blank, the primitive will use the Grp file if it
exists, or the stored reference image in the Cal object, or lastly
just use the first file in the Frm.

=item FRAME_OBJ

An ORAC-DR Frm object with files to be aligned. If left unset, the
current Frm is used.

=back

=head1 ALGORITHMS

Uses KAPPA WCSALIGN. This primitive is currently a very general
implementation.

=head1 FILE SUFFIX

Creates an output image per input image, each with a suffix of '_al'.
