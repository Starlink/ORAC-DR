=head1 NAME

_CALCULATE_EFFECTIVE_NEP_ - derive an effecitve NEP for an array

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _CALCULATE_EFFECTIVE_NEP_ IN=$nepfile

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive calculates the effective NEP given an image containing
NEP values. The effective NEP is defined as the square-root of the
reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocal squares of the NEP values:

NEP_eff = sqrt( 1 / sum_i (1/NEFD_i)**2  )

where NEP_i is the NEP for bolometer i and the sum is over all
bolometers.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following argument is supported:

=over 4

=item B<IN>

Name of input NEP file. No default. Note this must be the name of the
NEP file itself, not the top-level container NDF.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA

MATHS

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_FIND_IMAGE_STATISTICS_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

The primitive hash, C<%_CALCULATE_EFFECTIVE_NEP_> contains a single
key on exit called C<EFFNEP> which contains the value of the effective
NEP derived in this primitive. The value is C<undef> if the
calculation failed.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None.

=head1 NOTES

None.
