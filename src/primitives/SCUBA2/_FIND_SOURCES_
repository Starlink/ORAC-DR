=head1 NAME

_FIND_SOURCES_ - find sources in given image using SExtractor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _FIND_SOURCES_

 _FIND_SOURCES_ WRITE_CATALOGUE=1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Find the position of sources in the given image using
SExtractor. Returns an C<Astro::Catalog> object and optionally the
name of a catalogue written to disk.

This primitive is designed to work on a single image and will fail if
the current Frame object contains more than one file.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<DETECT_SIGMA>

Optional detection threshold in units of standard deviation. Default
is 5.

=item B<GROUP>

Only used if B<IMAGE> is not defined. If true, use the current
Group file. Otherwise, use the current Frame. Default is 0 (false).

=item B<IMAGE>

Name of image file to extract point sources from. No default, but if
left unset image will be determined by the B<GROUP> parameter.

=item B<MINPIX>

Minimum number of connected pixels defining a source. Default is 9.

=item B<POINT>

Flag to denote whether to return point sources in the
catalogue. Default is 0 (return all sources found).

=item B<WRITE_CATALOGUE>

Flag denote whether to write the catalogue to a disk file. Default is
0 (do not write catalogue).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item EXTRACTOR

EXTRACTOR (via the C<Starlink::Extractor> perl module)

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_GET_CATALOG_NAME_

=back

=head1 NOTES

Requires the following perl modules:

Starlink::Extractor, Astro::Catalog, Astro::WaveBand

See also L<_FIND_POINT_SOURCES_|_FIND_POINT_SOURCES_>.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

On completion the primitive hash C<%_FIND_SOURCES_> contains
the following keys:

=over 4

=item CATALOGUE

A catalogue in the form of an C<Astro::Coords> object containing
sources

=item CATALOGUE_NAME

Name of disk file containing catalogue. Will be undef if no file was
written.

=back

The Frame object is not updated.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

If the B<WRITE_CATALOGUE> flag is set, a catalogue file will be
written to disk. See L<_GET_CATALOGUE_NAME_|_GET_CATALOGUE_NAME_> for
details of the naming scheme.
