=head1 SYNOPSIS

_ADD_BOLONOISE_LOG_ENTRY_ PARAMS=$paramsref

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Write entry to a log file given properties of the bolometer noise
values.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following argument is supported:

=over 4

=item B<PARAMS>

=over 4

=item *

One entry is written each time this primitive is called. If multiple
files are to be processed, this primitive should be called multiple
times.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates an output log file called C<log.bolonoise>

=head1 LOGFILE FORMAT

The logfile has the following columns:

=over 4

=item UT

The UT date in C<YYYYMMDD.frac> format.

=item HST

The time of the observation in Hawaii.

=item Obs

The observation number.

=item Subarray
