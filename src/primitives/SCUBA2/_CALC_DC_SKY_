=head1 NAME

_CALC_DC_SKY_ - Calculate and optionally log a DC sky value

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  _CALC_DC_SKY_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates a mean sky value from either the specified image or all the
images in the current Frame. This primitive should be called before
calibration or mosaicking. If called with an input file, the sky value
will be returned in the primitive hash as C<DCSKY>.

This is a Frame operation and should be used before group operations.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported

=over 4

=item B<IMAGE>

Name of image to calculate sky level for. If left unset, the sky level
will be calculated for all the files in the current Frame.

=item B<METHOD>

Valid options are MEAN, MEDIAN or MODE. Default is MEAN.

=item B<LOGFILE>

Flag to denote whether to write results of sky removal to a log
file. Default is 1 (true).

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to print informative messages to the
screen. Default is false (0).
