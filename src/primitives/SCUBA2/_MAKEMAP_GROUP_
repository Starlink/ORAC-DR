=head1 NAME

_MAKEMAP_GROUP_

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  _MAKEMAP_GROUP_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes timeseries data for the current Group object and
constructs an image. The user may specify either the simple rebinning
method or the full iterative solution.

For the iterative map-maker a configuration file is obtained based on
the Frame uhdr entry C<MAKEMAP_CONFIG_TYPE>, though this may be
overriden with a recipe parameter. See
L<_GET_MAKEMAP_CONFIG_|_GET_MAKEMAP_CONFIG_> for further details.

The output file size is kept below 2 GB which in practice corresponds
to an image with about 60 million pixels (7745 pixels on a side, or
6.45 degrees on the sky for 3-arcsec pixels). Currently the primitive
creates a smaller image if the limit is exceeded. Each dimension is
reduced in proportion. The primitive aborts if the memory requirements
for processing the data exceeds that available.

This is a many to one operation, with only a single output file
created.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item B<CONFIG_TYPE>

Type of makemap configuration file to use. The choice is determined by
the type of object observed (and hence by the calling recipe). May be
C<BRIGHT>, C<EXTENDED> or C<FAINT> which use the normal, extended or
faint versions of the makemap configuration file. Default is C<FAINT>.

=item B<METHOD>

Image reconstruction method. May be C<REBIN> to use a simple rebinning
scheme or C<ITER> to use the iterative map-maker. The default is
C<ITER>.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_MAKEMAP_FRAME_

=back

=head1 NOTES

For use in batch mode only where all the groups are pre-calculated.

Proceeds only once the final Frame has been reached.

This primitive is a wrapper around L<_MAKEMAP_FRAME_|_MAKEMAP_FRAME_>.

Should work as advertised but is as yet untested.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates a single output file with a C<_mos> suffix.
