=head1 NAME

_DISPLAY_AVERAGE_NOISE_ - Calculate and display the average bolometer noise

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_DISPLAY_AVERAGE_NOISE_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive calculates the mean bolometer noise data for each
subarray using the individual noise images. The individual noise and
NEP images are stacked to form a cube which is collapsed to derive the
mean image. The mean noise/NEP images are stored in the current Frame
and displayed. The primitive only executes once an observation has
ended.

This primitive is designed to be called from the live pipelines
running at the telescope where data are analyzed as they are taken. It
should not be used offline because all the data for an observation are
processed together and there is no need to calculate C<average>
results.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive supports the following argument:

=over 4

=item B<COMP>

Component to display. Supported values are C<DATA> and C<ERR>. Default
is C<DATA>.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used by this primitive:

=over 4

=item KAPPA:

COLLAPSE

=item SMURF

STACKFRAMES

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES:

_DISPLAY_NOISE_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

The mean noise image per subarray is created with suffix C<_noi>. The
subscan number is stripped to differentiate it from the individual
noise files.
