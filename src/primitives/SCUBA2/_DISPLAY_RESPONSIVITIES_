=head1 NAME

_DISPLAY_RESPONSIVITIES_ - Display the current and previous bolometer responsivity maps

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_DISPLAY_RESPONSIVITIES_ ERR=1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive displays the current and previous bolometer
responsivity data in a single Kapview window. Images of the bolometer
responsivities are displayed on the same scale, along with histograms
of values (also on the same scale). The percentage change in
responsivity between the current and previous solutions is also
displayed as a 2-D image.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive supports the following arguments:

=over 4

=item B<CLIP>

Number of standard deviations at which to clip the data before
displaying the data on a histogram. The default (undef) is no
clipping.

=item B<COMP>

Component to display. Supported values are C<DATA> and C<ERR>. Default
is C<DATA>.

=item B<FRAME>

Name of ORAC::FRAME object to use. No default.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used by this primitive:

=over 4

=item KAPPA:

MATHS, NDFCOPY, SETTITLE, WCSFRAME

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES:

_FIND_IMAGE_STATISTICS_

=back

=head1 NOTES

The B<CLIP> parameter applies to the data in the current solution. The
corresponding absolute value is used to define the range of values to
be displayed from the previous solution.

This primitive relies on the current and previous responsivity files
corresponding to file numbers 2 and 3 in the given Frame object.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

On exit the given Frame object will contain the name of the percentage
change image. However, note that this file will be deleted at the end
of processing by the REDUCE_FLATFIELD recipe.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None.
