=head1 NAME

_CALC_SCUBA2_SNR_ - calculate a signal-to-noise ratio image

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _CALC_SCUBA2_SNR_

 _CALC_SCUBA2_SNR_ GROUP=1 STORE=1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creates a signal-to-noise ratio image using the data and variance
components of a given file. Some basic statistics are reported on
completion.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<GROUP>

Flag to denote whether to use the current Group or Frame file. Default
is 0 (use the current Frame).

=item B<IN>

Name of input image. Use file determined by the B<GROUP> parameter
above if not specified.

=item B<OUT>

Name of output image. Default is to use the C<inout> method to create
an output file with the suffix C<_snr>.

=item B<STORE>

A flag to denote whether or not the output image is to be stored in
the current Frame or Group. Default is 0 (no).

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to display extra information. Default is 1 (yes).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA

MAKESNR

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

If left to use defaults, creates a file with the suffix
C<_snr>. Otherwise creates the output file specified by the B<OUT>
parameter.

=head1 NOTES

None.
