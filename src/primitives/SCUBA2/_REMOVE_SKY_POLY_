=head1 NAME

_REMOVE_SKY_POLY_ - Subtracts a polynomial fit from time-series data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _REMOVE_SKY_POLY_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Subtracts a polynomial fit from uncalibrated time-series data. The
polynomial fit exists as an NDF component within the data files which
was written by the data-acquisition system. An error is generated if
this primitive is run on calibrated data since sky subtraction should
have been done already.

This is a Frame operation, operating on all files in the current Frame
object and should be used before Group operations.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has no arguments.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item SMURF:

REMSKY

=back

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates an output file with a C<_sky> extension. The Frame is updated
with the new file names.

=head1 NOTES

Assumes that this step should be done before calibration although it's
a bit late to tell the user that it should have been done at an
earlier stage.
