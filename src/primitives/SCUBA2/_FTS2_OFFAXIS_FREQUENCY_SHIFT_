_FTS2_OFFAXIS_FREQUENCY_SHIFT_

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_FTS2_OFFAXIS_FREQUENCY_SHIFT_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitives scales the frequency grid according to the different path
difference that off-axis rays travel through the interferometer.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates output files with a C<_frq> extension.
The Frame is updated with the output files.
