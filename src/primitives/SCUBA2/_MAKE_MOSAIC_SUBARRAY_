=head1 NAME

_MAKE_MOSAIC_SUBARRAY_ - Create mosaic from the four subarrays

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _MAKE_MOSAIC_SUBARRAY_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes the aligned sub-scan frames from each sub-array
and mosaics them into a single output image. Its use is optional but
it helps speed up _MAKE_MOSAIC_FRAME_ by reducing the number of
intercomparisons.

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

Assumes the _ALIGN_ARRAYS_ primitive has been run on the input images.

=head1 ALGORITHMS

Uses CCDPACK MAKEMOS. 

=head1 FILE SUFFIX

Creates an output image with a suffix of '_arr'.
