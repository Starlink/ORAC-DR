=head1 NAME

_MAKE_MOSAIC_SUBARRAY_ - Create mosaic from the four subarrays

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_MAKE_MOSAIC_SUBARRAY_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes the aligned sub-scan frames from each sub-array
and mosaics them into a single output image. Its use is optional but
it decreases processing time in the DREAM/STARE pipeline by reducing
the number of intercomparisons at the Frame mosaicking stage.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following argument is supported:

=over 4

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether helpful messages should be printed. Default is
0 (no).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item CCDPACK

MAKEMOS

=back

=head1 NOTES

Assumes the input images have been aligned to a common (sky)
coordinate frame. If not, the images will be mosaicked in pixel
coordinates.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

None.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates output images with a suffix of C<_arr> which are stored in the
current Frame object. The number of output files is reduced by a
factor equal to the number of subarrays (which should be 4).
