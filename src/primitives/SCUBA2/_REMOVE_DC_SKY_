=head1 NAME

_REMOVE_DC_SKY_ - Removes a DC sky value

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _REMOVE_DC_SKY_ METHOD=MEDIAN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Subtracts the mean value from an uncalibrated image. No action is
taken if the C<SKY_SUBTRACTION> flag is set in the Frame uhdr. The
primitive operates on all files in the current Frame, and will only
perform the action if sky subtraction has not already been carried out
on this Frame.

This primitive is an alternative to _REMOVE_PLANE_FROM_IMAGE_.

This is a Frame operation and should be used before group operations.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported

=over 4

=item B<LOGFILE>

Flag to denote whether to write results of sky removal to a log
file. Default is 1 (true).

v=item B<METHOD>

Valid options are MEAN, MEDIAN or MODE. Default is MEAN.

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to print informative messages to the
screen. Default is true (1).

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA:

CSUB

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES:

_CALC_DC_SKY_, ADD_SKY_LOG_ENTRY_

=back

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

Sets the C<SKY_SUBTRACTION> entry in the Frame uhdr.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates output files with a C<_sky> extension.  The Frame is updated
with the sky-subtracted files.

=head1 NOTES

Relies on the presence of the C<SKY_SUBTRACTION> entry in the Frame
uhdr to decide whether to proceed.

This primitive will operate on time-series data, though it is not
likely to yield a good result.
