=head1 NAME

_ALIGN_AND_MOSAIC_SUBARRAY - Align and mosaic subarray frames together

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _ALIGN_AND_MOSAIC_SUBARRAY

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive aligns and mosaics the individual subarray frames into
array images either by using KAPPA WCSALIGN followed by CCDPACK
MAKEMOS or performing both steps with KAPPA WCSMOSAIC. The former
approach calls two other primitives to do the aligning and
mosaicking. A check is made to see if the version of KAPPA supports
WCSMOSAIC.

This primitive operates on the current Frame object and selects images
in groups of up to four (one for each subarray) and produces a mosaic
of these images. No operation is performed is there is only a single
subarray.

If the output need not be aligned to a celestial reference frame, then
if a group file exists, that is the reference for the alignment, else
the first image in the frame object is chosen as reference.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item B<MAKEMOS>

A flag to denote whether to use CCDPACK MAKEMOS for mosaicking the
images. Default is 0 (no), which uses KAPPA WCSMOSAIC instead.

=item B<METHOD>

The method to be used for resampling the aligned images. This
corresponds to the C<method> parameter for WCSMOSAIC and WCSALIGN,
which is different from that for MAKEMOS. See WCSALIGN and/or
WCSMOSAIC documentation for further details. Default value is
C<nearest>.

=item B<MAKEMOS_METHOD>

The method by which MAKEMOS combines the images. Default is
C<mean>. See the MAKEMOS documentation for a description of the
possible values.

=item B<REBIN>

A flag to determine whether to rebin or resample. Default is
resample. See the WCSMOSAIC/WCSALIGN documentation for further
information.

=item B<SKYREF>

A flag to denote whether to align the images to a celestial coordinate
frame. The default is 0 (false) and the images will be aligned with
either the group file if it exists or the first image in the Frame.

=item B<VERBOSE>

A flag to denote whether the primitive should issue verbose
information messages. Default is true (1).

=back

=head1 ALGORITHMS

KAPPA: WCSMOSAIC, WCSALIGN. CCDPACK: MAKEMOS

=head1 FILE SUFFIX

An output file is created for each set of up-to-four subarray images
in the Frame with a suffix of C<_arr>.
