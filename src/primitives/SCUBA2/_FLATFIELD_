=head1 NAME

_FLATFIELD_

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_FLATFIELD_ 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive applies the flatfield correction to all files in the
current frame using the flatfield information in the raw data
files. Bad-bolometer masks for each subarray are retrieved from the
Calibration system if they exist.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

None.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external task is used:

=over 4

=item SMURF

FLATFIELD

=back

=head1 NOTES

This is a many-to-fewer operation if the list of input files contains
dark frames (as it should). Note that the output file names will not
correspond directly to the input names. This is because the routine
that removes the dark frames from the list of files truncates the list
at the appropriate number of files, rather than removing corresponding
dark file names. Of course, the pipeline doesn't care about the names
since it operates solely on the header information.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

On completion, the Frame object contains the flatfielded data files.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates output files with a C<_ff> suffix.
