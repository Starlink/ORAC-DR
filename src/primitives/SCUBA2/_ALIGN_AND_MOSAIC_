=head1 NAME

_ALIGN_AND_MOSAIC_ - Align and mosaic frames together

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _ALIGN_AND_MOSAIC_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive aligns and mosaics frames either by using KAPPA
WCSALIGN followed by CCDPACK MAKEMOS or performing both steps with
KAPPA WCSMOSAIC. The former approach calls two other primitives to do
the aligning and mosaicking. A check is made to see if the version of
KAPPA supports WCSMOSAIC.

If a group file exists, that is the reference for the alignment, else
the first image is chosen as reference.

This primitive operates on the current Frame object and mosaics all
files in the current Frame to produce a single output mosaic.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item SINGLESTEP

A flag to determine whether to perform the alignment and mosaicking in
one step using WCSMOSAIC. Default is 1 (Yes). If set to 0, then the
following argument MUST be set. Note that the values of the METHOD and
REBIN parameters are passed on to the primitives called if SINGLESTEP
is 0.

=item METHOD

Keyword specifying the method for determing how the output pixels are
populated. The default is nearest-neighbour resampling
(C<nearest>). See the documentation for WCSMOSAIC or WCSALIGN for
further details. The recommended choices are C<nearest>, C<bilinear>,
ir C<sincsinc>.

=item REBIN

A flag to determine whether to rebin or resample. Default is
resample. See the WCSMOSAIC/WCSALIGN documentation for further
information.

=item COMBINE

The method to be used to combine the images. In principle could be any
value supported by MAKEMOS (see MAKEMOS documentation for further
details). Currently, only MEAN or MEDIAN are supported. MEDIAN is the
default.

=back

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

If no group file is present the primitive should create a non-rotated
RA/Dec reference based on the world coordinates of the first frame.
Currently, if the world coordinates are rotated the output aligned
frames will be rotated (as will be the case for a SCUBA-2 image
aligned with Nasmyth coordinates).

=head1 ALGORITHMS

Uses KAPPA WCSMOSAIC. This primitive is currently a very general
implementation.

=head1 FILE SUFFIX

Creates a single output mosaic image with a suffix of C<_mos>.
