=head1 NAME

_CREATE_RESP_CUBE_ - Create a cube of responsivity images

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CREATE_RESP_CUBE_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive creates a 3-d cube of responsivity images as a function
of time to allow stable bolometers to be identified. A cube is created
for each subarray. A new cube is created each time this primitive is
called and existing ones are not deleted.

This is a Frame operation, though output filenames are based on the
Group name.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive has no arguments.
