=head1 NAME

_COPY_RAW_DATA_ - Copy data from input directory to output directory.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_COPY_RAW_DATA_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive copies the input data (which typically resides in
$ORAC_DATA_IN) to the $ORAC_DATA_OUT directory unchanged.

The Frame object is updated with the new files.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following argument is supported:

=over 4

=item B<SUBIMAGES>

If true, only copy files that are associated with sub images (.I1,
 .I2, ... .In etc). This means that raw time series will not be copied
but DREAM and STARE images will be. Default is to copy anything.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

=over 4

=item KAPPA:

NDFCOPY

=back

=head1 NOTES

This primitive is suitable for SCUBA-2.

Dark frames will not be copied.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

A file whose filename is of the same form as the input file, but with
suffix C<_raw> appended.
