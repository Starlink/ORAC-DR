_EXTINCTION_CORRECT_FRAME_

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  _EXTINCTION_CORRECT_FRAME_ EXTCOR=QUICK

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive corrects each image in the current Frame for
atmospheric extinction. The method for deriving the correction can be
specified by the user depending on how accurate it should be and/or
how fast it should be applied. The default is to use the quickest
method possible, which is to calculate a mean optical depth and
airmass for all the files in the current Frame and multiply each file
by the same correction factor.

In FULL mode SMURF EXTINCTION is used to apply the extinction
correction on a per-pixel basis using information from the WVM stored
in the internal RTS state structure (if the input is timestream data)
or the WVM reading in the FITS header (if the input is 2-D image
data).

In QUICK mode, SMURF EXTINCTION is used to apply an extinction
correction to each frame using the mean optical depth stored in the
FITS header for that file.

In QUICKER mode the extinction correction is calculated as a single
value and is applied to all images in the Frame object using the KAPPA
CMULT routine.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item B<EXTCOR>

Type of extinction correction to be applied. If set to FULL, then an
accurate pixel-level correction is applied taking into account the
airmass of individual pixels. If set to QUICKER then the image is
corrected assuming a single value for the airmass across the image for
all images in the current Frame. An intermediate level correction may
be applied by specifying QUICK whereby the airmass and optical depth
for each file is used to correct that file. Default value is
C<QUICKER>.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

=over 4

=item Starlink 

KAPPA: CMULT, SMURF: EXTINCTION

=back

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

To be accurate the mean tau and airmass should be read from each
subframe rather than a mean for the entire observation. This also
requires that the extinction correction occurs before mosaicking
in the non-QuickLook recipe.

Note that this primitive relies on SMURF using its own internal tau
conversion methods. For consistency these should be identical to those
in JCMT::Tau.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates output files with suffix C<_ext>
