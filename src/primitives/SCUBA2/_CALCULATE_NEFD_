=head1 NAME

_CALCULATE_NEFD_

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_CALCULATE_NEFD_ ESTIMATOR=MEAN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculate the Noise Equivalent Flux Density (NEFD) of the current
observation.

The NEFD is calculated in one of two ways. One method is suitable for
use with NOISE observations and scales the noise equivalent power
(NEP) by the flux conversion factor (FCF) and corrects for atmospheric
attenuation. The other method, suitable for use with image data,
estimates the noise in the image (from the variance) and multiplies by
the square-root of the integration time.

<<<<<<< HEAD:src/primitives/SCUBA2/_CALCULATE_NEFD_
NEFD = noise * sqrt(time)
=======
The units of NEFD are mJy sqrt(s). The integration time is derived from
the C<EXP_TIME> extension in the image.
>>>>>>> master:src/primitives/SCUBA2/_CALCULATE_NEFD_

The choice of method is dictated by the observing mode.

The results are written to a log file, C<log.nefd>.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<ESTIMATOR>

Preferred estimator for integration time or NEP. Valid options are
C<MEAN>, C<MEDIAN> or C<MODE>. Default is C<MEDIAN>.

=item B<GROUP>

Flag to indicate whether to obtain results from the Group file. Only
accessed for non-NOISE observations. Default is 0 (use the current
Frame).

=item B<LOGFILE>

Flag to indicate whether or not to write a log file to disk. Default
is 1 (write a log file).

=item B<VERBOSE>

Flag to denote whether to print extra messages. Default is 0 (no).

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA

COPYBAD

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES:

_FIND_IMAGE_STATISTICS_, _FIND_VARIANCE_, _GET_LOG_PARAMETERS_,
_MASK_AST_REGION_

=back

=head1 NOTES

Points to note when deriving the NEFD from an image:

=over 4

=item * The data must be calibrated.

=item * The data are masked to only include values within the bounds
of the requested map (as defined by the FITS headers). This ensures
that noisy pixels at the edge of the map do not affect the
calculation.

=item * This primitive assumes the current Frame or Group contains
only a single file, and is a no-op if there are multiple files. A
warning is issued in this case.

=back

This primitive currently gives erroneous results in offline mode for
deriving the NEFD from noise data.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

If no log file is to be written, then the primitive hash contains the
key C<NEFD> with the calculated NEFD.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Optionally writes a log file C<log.nefd>.
