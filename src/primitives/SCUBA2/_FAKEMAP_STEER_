=head1 NAME

_FAKEMAP_STEER_ - store steering parameters for reducing SCAN-mode data with a fake map added

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _FAKEMAP_STEER_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive checks for the presence of recipe parameters and sets
entries in the Frame uhdr accordingly.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

None.

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

None.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

Parameters are stored in the Frame uhdr using the naming convention
C<RECPAR_PARAMETER> where PARAMETER is the name of the recipe
parameter.

See the documentation for the
L<REDUCE_SCAN_FAKEMAP|REDUCE_SCAN_FAKEMAP> recipe for a list of
supported parameters.

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

None.

=head1 NOTES

the C<%RECPARS> hash must have been initialized by
L<_REDUCE_SCAN_STEER_|_REDUCE_SCAN_STEER_>.
