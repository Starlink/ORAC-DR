=head1 NAME

_FIND_VARIANCE_ - Retrieves the variance from a mosaicked image

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _FIND_VARIANCE_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive determines the statistics of the variance or error
components within an NDF and reports the mean and standard
deviation. The mean is expected to be a good estimate of the noise.

On completion of the calculation, the primitive hash
$_FIND_VARIANCE_{RESULT}. If there is no variance component, then the
entry is set to undef.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item B<IMAGE>

Name of NDF image to obtain the variance from. If left blank then the
current group file is assumed.

=item B<COMP>

Component to probe in NDF. May be variance (var) or error
(err). Default is variance. Note the error is the square-root of the
variance.

=back

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

Performs a simple check if the variance component is present.

=head1 ALGORITHMS

Uses KAPPA STATS and NDFTRACE.
