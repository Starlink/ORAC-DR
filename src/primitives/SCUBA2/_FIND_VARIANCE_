=head1 NAME

_FIND_VARIANCE_ - Retrieves the variance from a mosaicked image

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 _FIND_VARIANCE_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive determines the statistics of the variance or error
components within an NDF and reports the mean and standard
deviation. The mean is expected to be a good estimate of the noise.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item COMP

Component to probe in NDF. Maybe variance or error. Default is error (err).

=back

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

Does not check if the error component is present.

=head1 ALGORITHMS

Uses KAPPA STATS.
