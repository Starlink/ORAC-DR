=head1 NAME

_MAKEMAP_FRAME_

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  _MAKEMAP_FRAME_ PIXSIZE=7.5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive takes timeseries data for the current frame and
constructs an image. This is a many to one operation, with only a
single output file created.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported.

=over 4

=item B<PIXSIZE>

PIXSIZE is the size of the output pixels in arcsec. The default is
equal to the pixel spacing (ie 6 arcsec).

=item B<SYSTEM>

Coordinate system for output image. May be any supported by
C<AST>. Default is C<TRACKING>.

=item B<SPREAD>

Desired pixel-spreading scheme. May be either C<nearest> for 
nearest-neighbour resampling or C<linear> for bi-linear resampling. 
Default is C<nearest>.

=item B<METHOD>

Image reconstruction method. May be C<REBIN> to use a simple rebinning
scheme or C<ITER> to use the iterative map-maker. If C<ITER> is
specified then the following parameters must also be set to override
the defaults (which may not do what you want).

=item B<MYCONFIG>

A flag to denote that the a user-defined config file is to be
used. Default is 0 (use system config file).

=back

In addition, configuration parameters for B<MAKEMAP> may be specified,
provided the B<MYCONFIG> argument is true. See the B<MAKEMAP>
documentation for supported parameters.

=head1 FILE SUFFIX

Creates a single output file with a '_fmos' suffix.
