=head1 NAME

_ADD_NOISE_LOG_ENTRY_ - Write noise log entry to disk

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_ADD_NOISE_LOG_ENTRY_ SIGMA=0.01

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Write entry to a log file given an estimate of the noise properties of
the current Frame or Group image.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item B<GROUP>

Flag to denote whether the Group file or Frame file has been
used. Default is 0 (use the Frame file).

=item B<SIGMA>

Noise level in current units

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES:

_GET_LOG_PARAMETERS_

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

One entry is written each time this primitive is called. If multiple
files are to be processed, this primitive should be called multiple
times.

=item *

Obtains header values from the current Frame or Group depending on the
value of the B<GROUP> parameter.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT FILES

Creates an output log file called C<log.noise>

=head1 LOGFILE FORMAT

The logfile has the following columns:

=over 4

=item UT

The UT date in C<YYYYMMDD.frac> format.

=item HST

The time of the observation in Hawaii.

=item Obs

The observation number.

=item Source

The source name.

=item Mode

The observing mode.

=item Filter

The specific filter associated with the noise measurement.

=item Elevation

The elevation of the observation.

=item CSO

Equivalent CSO tau derived from the tau used to reduce
the observation.

=item Tau

The tau value used for the reduction.

=item Seeing

The seeing value as stored in the header.

=item Sigma

Noise level in current units.

=back
