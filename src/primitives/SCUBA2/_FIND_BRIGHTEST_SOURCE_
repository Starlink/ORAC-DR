=head1 NAME

_FIND_BRIGHTEST_SOURCE_ - Find the brightest source in an image

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_FIND_BRIGHTEST_SOURCE_ BOX=15

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Find the position of the brightest source in the current frame. Makes
no assumption that the centroid is near the origin in axis
coordinates. Uncertainties in the position are not reported.

The Frame object is not updated.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are supported:

=over 4

=item BOX

Size of search box in each dimension. Default is 9 pixels.

=item WCSFRAME

WCS frame to use. Default is PIXEL if none specified.

=back

=head1 EXTERNAL TASKS

The following external tasks are used:

=over 4

=item KAPPA:

CENTROID, STATS

=item ORAC-DR PRIMITIVES

_CREATE_IMAGE_CATALOGUE_, _GET_CATALOGUE_NAME_

=back

=head1 NOTES

Assumes that the peak value in the map is the value of the pixel at
the centroid position. This is not necessarily true though if the
centroid position contains a spike.

This primitive is designed to work on a single image and will fail if
the current Frame object contains more than one file.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

On completion the primitive hash C<%_FIND_BRIGHTEST_SOURCE_> contains
the following keys:

=over 4

=item RESULTS

An array containing the X, Y position of the brightest source in the
file. Contains C<undef> if no sources were found. Starts counting at 1
(same as for the file() method). Each element in the array contains a
2 element array with the X and Y offsets. The units are determined by
the current WCS frame.

=item WCSFRAME

A string denoting the WCS frame used so that the RESULTS can be
correctly interpreted.
