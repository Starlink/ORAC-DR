=head1 NAME

_DISPLAY_NOISE_ - Display bolometer noise

=head1 SYNOPSIS

_DISPLAY_NOISE_

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive displays the bolometer noise data in a Kapview
window. Each noise image in the current Frame object is displayed in
turn, each in a separate Kapview window. An image is displayed on the
left side and a histogram on the right. The statistics (mean, median
and sigma) are reported.

If the C<CLIP> argument is given, the noise statistics are
re-calculated using sigma-clipping and reported in addition to the
unclipped values.

The scale for the display is set by the clipped values if appropriate
in case of significant outliers.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

This primitive supports the following arguments:

=over 4

=item B<CLIP>

Number of standard deviations at which to clip the data before
displaying the data on a histogram. The default (undef) is no
clipping.

=item B<COMP>

Component to display. Supported values are C<DATA> and C<ERR>. Default
is C<DATA>.
