=head1 NAME

FIX_INCONSISTENT_OBJECT - Set OBJECT header to first value from group

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe can be used to correct raw data where observations have been
taken with inconsistent values of the OBJECT header.  The first OBJECT
header value found is set for all subsequent files in the group for which
it differs, under the assumption that the pipeline will already have grouped
the files appropriately.
