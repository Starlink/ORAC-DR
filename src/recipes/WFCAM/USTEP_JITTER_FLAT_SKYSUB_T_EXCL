# Name:
#    USTEP_JITTER_FLAT_SKYSUB_T_EXCL

# Purpose:
#    Standard processing for tile including interleaving, jittering,
#    flat and sky correction. Sky estimate is from all images in
#    the tile except the jitter sequence to which the current frame belongs.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe does the instrumental signature processing on frames and
#    then various combinations. This includes:
#	- Dark correction and flat fielding, both using pre-existing master
#	  frames.
#	- Sky estimation and subtraction. This is done by combining all of the
#	  frames in the current tile except those from the jitter sequence to
#         which the current frame belongs.
#	- Interleaving
#       - Dithering
#       - Object extraction and classification
#       - WCS Fitting
#       - Photometric zero point calculation
#	- Filing of DQC information
#	- Display of the final dither frame.
#

# Notes:
#    -  Because we have to wait until all of the frames from the current tile
#       are available before doing the sky estimate, none of the combinations
#	will be done until that time.
#

# Output Data:
#    -  Interleaved super frames and confidence maps
#    -  Dithered stacked frames and confidence maps.
#    -  All combined frames are astrometrically and photometrically calibrated

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    None

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing is all done with CIRDR routines.

interleaving, jittering, flat and sky correction. Sky estimate is from all 
images in the tile except the jitter sequence to which the current frame 
belongs.

This recipe does the instrumental signature processing on frames and
then various combinations. This includes:

Dark correction and flat fielding, both using pre-existing master frames.

Sky estimation and subtraction. This is done by combining all of the
frames in the current tile except those from the jitter sequence to
which the current frame belongs.

=item *

Because we have to wait until all of the frames from the current tile
are available before doing the sky estimate, none of the combinations
will be done until that time.
