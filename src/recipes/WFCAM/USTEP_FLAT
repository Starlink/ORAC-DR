# Name:
#    USTEP_FLAT

# Purpose:
#    Dark correct and flat field a microstep sequence. Interleave it and
#    do astrometric and photometric calibration on the derived catalogue.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe does the following to a microstep sequence:
#	- Dark correction and flat fielding, both using pre-existing master
#	  frames.
#	- Interleaving
#       - Object extraction and classification
#       - WCS Fitting
#       - Photometric zero point calculation
#	- Filing of DQC information
#	- Display of the final dither frame.
#

# Notes:
#    None

# Output Data:
#    -  Interleaved super frames and confidence maps
#    -  All super frames are astrometrically and photometrically calibrated

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    None

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing is all done with CIRDR routines.

#    None
