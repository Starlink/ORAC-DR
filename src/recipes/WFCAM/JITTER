# Name:
#    JITTER

# Purpose:
#    Standard processing for jitter including interleaving, jittering,
#    flat and sky correction. Sky correction is done with quadant filtering
#    The final processing that must be done to the jitter sequence as a 
#    whole is done in a spawned subprocess.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe does the instrumental signature processing on frames and
#    then various combinations. This includes:
#	- Dark correction and flat fielding, both using pre-existing master
#	  frames.
#	- Background estimation is done with median filtering of the quadrants.
#	- Interleaving
#       - Dithering
#       - Object extraction and classification
#       - WCS Fitting
#       - Photometric zero point calculation
#	- Filing of DQC information
#	- Display of the final dither frame.
#

# Notes:
#    None
#

# Output Data:
#    -  Interleaved super frames and confidence maps
#    -  Dithered stacked frames and confidence maps.
#    -  All combined frames are astrometrically and photometrically calibrated

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    None

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing is all done with CIRDR routines.
