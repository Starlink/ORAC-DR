=head1 NAME

CALC_SCUBA2_AVPSPEC - Calculate average bolometer power spectra from SCUBA-2 data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple PICARD recipe to calculate the average bolometer power
spectra from raw SCUBA-2 data.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

The input data must be raw SCUBA-2 data

=item *

Produces one output file per subarray with suffix C<_avpspec>.

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

The power spectrum for each file is displayed if desired, up to a
maximum of four. Note that a suitable C<disp.dat> must be present in
the output directory, or the environment variable C<ORAC_DATA_CAL>
must point to the location of the SCUBA-2 version.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameter can be set via the -recpar option:

=over 2

=item DISPLAY

Flag to control the display of power spectra. The recipe will attempt
to display spectra by default.
