=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_DISPLAY_PCA - Calculate and display properties of PCA components

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple PICARD recipe to apply PCA processing to raw SCUBA-2 data.

The input data should contain a fast-ramp flatfield (taken prior to
the target data).

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item LOGFILE

Flag to denote whether to write results to a log file at the end of
processing. Default is 1 (write a log file).

=item PCA_COMP

PCA components to analyze and display. Default is 0 to 5. The
components may be specified either as a comma-separated list
(e.g. 0,1,2,3 etc - they need not be contiguous or in order), or as a
Perl array slice (e.g. 0..3). The number of components must be no more
than 8. If more than 8 are given, only the first 8 are used.

=item PCA_KEEPFILES

Flag to indicate which files should be kept on disk. Default is 1
which keeps the PCA amplitude, component and power spectrum files on
disk. A value of 0 deletes all files, while a value of -1 indicates
that all files should be kept on disk.

=item PCA_REUSE

Flag to indicate that existing data should be used if present. Default
is 1 (reuse).

=back

=head1 NOTES

Input data should be from a single subarray only, and for a single
observation. However, no checks are made that this is actually the
case.

If results are to be calculated by the recipe, then all the input data
are used. This could lead to long run times with a large number of
files as the data are pre-processed with SMURF C<sc2clean>.

=head1 DISPLAY

The results for each chosen PCA component are displayed in up to two
KAPVIEW windows. The left-hand column displays the amplitude scaled
between +/-2 sigma, the next column displays the component as a
function of time and the third column shows the power spectrum of each
component. Each KAPVIEW window can display results for up to 4 PCA
components.
