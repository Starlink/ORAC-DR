CREATE_MOMENTS_MAP

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe is used to create a moments map (or multiple moments maps)
from a cube. It smooths the cube in frequency and spatial extents,
then finds clumps of emission. Everything in the cube not found in a
clump is masked out, then the masked cube is collapsed to form the
moments map.
