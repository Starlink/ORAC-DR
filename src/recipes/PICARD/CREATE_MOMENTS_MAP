=head1 NAME

CREATE_MOMENTS_MAP - Creates a moments map from a spectral-line cube

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe is used to create a moments map (or multiple moments maps)
from a cube.  It smooths the cube in frequency and spatial extents,
then finds clumps of emission.  Everything in the cube not found in a
clump is masked out, then the masked cube is collapsed to form the
moments map.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item BASELINE_ORDER

The polynomial order that will be used when estimating baselines.  [1]

=item FREQUENCY_SMOOTH

The number of channels to smooth in the frequency axis when smoothing
to determine baselines. This number should be small (~10) for
narrow-line observations and large (~25) for broad-line observations. [25]

=item MOMENTS

The moment maps to create.  These are any of the values allowed for the
ESTIMATOR parameter to the C<COLLAPSE> task, but in reality this should
probably be 'integ', 'iwc', and/or 'itd'.  Any number of moments can be
given in a comma-separated string.  ['integ']

=item MOMENTS_LOWER_VELOCITY

An optional lower velocity in km/s, below which no data will be used
when creating the moments map.  When it is undefined, the full velocity
range is used.  [undef]

=item MOMENTS_SNR

Whether or not to do clump detection on an signal-to-noise cube instead
of the signal cube.  Enabling this is useful for data taken in varying
conditions.  [0]

=item MOMENTS_UPPER_VELOCITY

An optional upper velocity in km/s, above which no data will be used
when creating the moments map.  When it is undefined, the full velocity
range is used.  [undef]

=item SPATIAL_SMOOTH

The number of pixels to smooth in both spatial axes when smoothing to
determine baselines.  [3]

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item  The Clumpfind algorithm selects the emission by walking down peaks
to lower intensities.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 2

=item For each moment chosen through the C<MOMENTS> parameter there is
NDF called pgE<lt>utdateE<gt>_E<lt>obsnoE<gt>_E<lt>momentE<gt>, where
E<lt>utdateE<gt> is the UT date, E<lt>obsnoE<gt> is the observation
number (without any leading zeroes), and E<lt>momentE<gt> is the
moment name.

=item A spectrum from the highest signal in NDF
pgE<lt>utdateE<gt>_E<lt>obsnoE<gt>_sp.
