=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_MATCHED_FILTER - Apply a matched filter to input images

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Apply a matched filter to SCUBA-2 images with the aim of enhancing
point sources. The given images are convolved with a PSF, which the
user can supply or is created by the recipe. Before the convolution,
the maps and the PSF are smoothed with a gaussian, and these smoothed
versions are subtracted from the unsmoothed versions.

The default PSF is a two-component gaussian model of the JCMT beam
with relative amplitudes and FWHM as given in the SCUBA-2 calibration
paper (Mairs et al. 2021, AJ, 162, 191).

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

Cropping the images before applying this filter to remove large-scale
junk around the edge can improve results.

=item *

Input data should all be able to use the same PSF image (if specified).

=item *

Creates an output file for each input file with suffix C<_mf>.

=item *

If no PSF supplied, creates a PSF file for each input file with suffix
C<_psf> unless the C<KEEPFILES> recipe parameter is false.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item B<KEEPFILES>

A flag to indicate that the PSF created by this recipe should remain
on disk after processing. If not specified, the PSF will be deleted if
one is created. This parameter is ignored if a PSF file is given (see
C<PSF_MATCHFILTER>).

=item B<PSF_MATCHFILTER>

Name of an NDF file containing a suitable PSF. Must exist in the
current working directory. If not specified, the recipe will calculate
one itself for each input file.

=item B<PSF_NORM>

Normalization scheme used for the PSF created by this recipe if one is
not specified using the above parameter. Maybe be C<PEAK> or C<SUM> to
indicate whether the Gaussian PSF should have a peak of unity or a sum
of unity. If not specified, the recipe assumes C<PEAK>.

=item B<SMOOTH_DATA>

Flag to denote whether or not the image and PSF should be smoothed and
have the smoothed version subtracted from the original. If not
specified, the recipe assumes a value of 1 (smooth and subtract).

=item B<SMOOTH_FWHM>

FWHM of Gaussian used to smooth data and PSF images before convolving
with the PSF. If not specified the recipe assumes 30 arcsec.

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

None.
