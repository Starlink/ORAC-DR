=head1 NAME

SCUBA2_FLUXNOISE - Recipe for calculating fluxes and noise levels for SCUBA-2 images

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple PICARD recipe to calculate fluxes, FCFs and NEFDs from a
given source. The results are written to a log file called
C<log.fluxnoise> if desired.

The FCF calculation requires uncalibrated data and thus must be
performed first. However, note that the NEFD calculation must be
carried out using the (calibrated) original input data.

By default this recipe only works on known calibration
sources. However, the user may specify the source flux at 850 and/or
450 um by using recipe parameters called C<FLUX_850> and C<FLUX_450>
respectively.

If the user specifies the B<LOGFILE> parameter, then the primitives
will collate data for each input file (including results of
calculations) into a hash indexed by the relevant keywords. The hash
for each files is stored in an array reference in the Frame uhdr entry
C<PICARD_RESULTS>. The order of elements in the array matches that for
the input files. See L<_GET_CURRENT_RESULTS_|_GET_CURRENT_RESULTS_>
and the primitives below for examples of the data stored. These
results are then written to a log file on completion of the recipe.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpar option:

=over 4

=item APERTURE_RADIUS

Radius of aperture in arcsec for calculating total flux.

=item FLUX_450

Source flux density at 450 um in Jy.

=item FLUX_850

Source flux density at 850 um in Jy.

=item LOGFILE

Flag to denote whether to collect data to write to a log file at the
end of processing.

=back

=head1 NOTES

The input data must be uncalibrated in order to calculate an FCF from
calibrator observations.

The results of the FCF and NEFD calculation are printed to the screen
and written to log files, C<log.fcf> and C<log.nefd>.

If run on non-calibrator data, the user should ensure that data from
only one source is used as the recipe uses the same (user-specified)
flux for all non-calibrator sources.

=head1 DISPLAY

No display is used by this recipe.
