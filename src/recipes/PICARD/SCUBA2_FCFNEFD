SCUBA2_FCFNEFD - Recipe for calculating fluxes and noise levels for SCUBA-2 images

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple PICARD recipe to calculate fluxes, FCFs and NEFDs from a
given source. The results are written to a log file called
C<log.fcfnefd> if desired.

The images are cropped to the given size (as specified in the FITS
headers or via the C<MAP_HEIGHT> and C<MAP_WIDTH> recipe parameters,
and must be at least twice the diameter of the aperture) before having
the background fitted and removed. The FCFs are calculated from these
cropped, background-subtracted images. The source flux and image-plane
noise are derived from aperture photometry on these images. NEFDs are
calculated using the original input images (calibrated using either
standard FCFs or those derived in the recipe).

The FCF calculation requires uncalibrated data and thus must be
performed first. However, note that the NEFD calculation must be
carried out using the original input data.

By default this recipe only works on known calibration
sources. However, the user may specify the source flux at 850 and/or
450 um by using recipe parameters called C<FLUX_850> and C<FLUX_450>
respectively. The fluxes for different sources may be specified by
appending the target name (in upper case with spaces removed),
e.g. C<FLUX_850.HLTAU>.

By default a log file is written containing a variety of information
about the data and the values calculated.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 4

=item APERTURE_RADIUS

Radius of aperture in arcsec for calculating total flux.

=item FLUX_450

Source flux density at 450 um in Jy. Source-specific values may be
given by appending the source name in upper case with spaces removed.

=item FLUX_850

Source flux density at 850 um in Jy. Source-specific values may be
given by appending the source name in upper case with spaces removed.

=item LOGFILE

Flag to denote whether to write results to a log file at the end of
processing.

=item MAP_HEIGHT

Height of map in arcsec after cropping. Must be at least twice the
aperture diameter.

=item MAP_WIDTH

Width of map in arcsec after cropping. Must be at least twice the
aperture diameter.

=item MASK_SOURCE

Flag to denote whether to mask the source before removing the
background. Default is 0 (do not mask the source).

=item BACKGROUND_FITMETHOD

Method to use for removing background. May be C<fitsurface>,
C<findback>, C<plane> or C<dc>. Default is C<fitsurface>.

=item FITSURFACE_FITTYPE

Type of fit to use with fitsurface. May be C<polynomial> or
C<spline>. Default is C<polynomial>.

=item FITSURFACE_FITPAR

Up to two values which define either the order of the polynomial (for
C<polynomial>) or the number of knots (for C<spline>) in the X and Y
directions respectively. A single number means the same value is used
for both axes. Default is 2 for C<polynomial>, 4 for C<spline>.

=item FITSURFACE_KEEPSURFACE

A flag to denote whether or not to keep the fitted surface on
disk. Useful for debugging purposes. Default is 0 (do not keep on
disk).

=item FINDBACK_BOX

Size of the box (in pixels) used by findback. Default is 11.

=item USEFCF

Flag to denote whether to calibrate the data using the FCFs derived in
this recipe (1) or use standard FCFs (0). Standard FCFs will be used
if not specified.

=back

=head1 NOTES

The input data must be uncalibrated in order to calculate an FCF from
calibrator observations.

Re-processing data already processed by this recipe is not
recommended.

=head1 DISPLAY

No display is used by this recipe.
