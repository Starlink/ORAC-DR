=head1 NAME

REMOVE_BACKGROUND - Remove a background from images

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple PICARD recipe to fit and remove a background from an image.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

The images should not be of extended sources.

=item *

This primitive creates an output file for each input file with a
suffix <_back> which will replace the existing suffix.

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

No display is used by this recipe.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 2

=item MASK_SOURCE

Flag to denote whether to mask the source before removing the
background. Default is 0 (do not mask the source).

=item APERTURE_RADIUS

Radius of aperture (in arcsec) used to mask out source. Default is
about twice the beamsize.

=item BACKGROUND_FITMETHOD

Method to use for removing background. May be C<fitsurface>,
C<findback>, C<plane> or C<dc>. Default is C<fitsurface>.

=item FITSURFACE_FITTYPE

Type of fit to use with fitsurface. May be C<polynomial> or
C<spline>. Default is C<polynomial>.

=item FITSURFACE_FITPAR

Up to two values which define either the order of the polynomial (for
C<polynomial>) or the number of knots (for C<spline>) in the X and Y
directions respectively. A single number means the same value is used
for both axes. Default is 2 for C<polynomial>, 4 for C<spline>.

=item FITSURFACE_KEEPSURFACE

A flag to denote whether or not to keep the fitted surface on
disk. Useful for debugging purposes. Default is 0 (do not keep on
disk).

=item FINDBACK_BOX

Size of the box (in pixels) used by findback. Default is 11.

=back

Default values are those used if the parameter is not specified.
