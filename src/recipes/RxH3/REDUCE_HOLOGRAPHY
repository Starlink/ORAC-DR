REDUCE_HOLOGRAPHY - Reduce RxH3 Holography map

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe attempts to perform the complete reduction of an RxH3
holography map.  The following steps are performed:

=over 4

=item

An initial pattern map is created to allow pointing offsets to be
estimated.  (If recipe parameter POINTING_OFFSET is not specified.)

=item

The raw data are gridded to create pattern map, using the pointing
offsets previously estimated or given via the recipe parameter.

=item

A Fourier transform is performed to convert the raw pattern map
to an aperture map.

=item

The position of the secondary diffraction pattern is estimated by
fitting the outermost minimum of the amplitude of the aperture map.

=item

Phase corrections are applied.

=item

The phase map is masked to exclude areas which do not form part of the
primary dish, or are shadowed by the legs supporting the secondary mirror.

=item

The phases are then converted to offset distances.

=item

The offset maps for each frequency are collapsed to a single map
by taking the mean value.

=item

Large scale distortions are subtracted by fitting a model based
on Zernike polynomials plus a custom defocus term.  (See recipe
parameters FIT_N_ORDER, FIT_TERMS and FIT_DEFOCUS for how this
process can be controlled.)

=item

Dish panel models are fitted to the mean offset map in order to
estimate the panel moves necessary to improve the surface.
The RMS deviation is calculated before and after this fitting process.

=head1 RECIPE PARAMETERS

=over 2

=item EXTRACT_CALIBRATION

Whether to extract calibration information (via MAKEHOLOMAP's
DEBUGCAL parameters).  This can be plotted to assess the stability
of the system during the observation.

=item FIT_DEFOCUS

Whether to include the custom defocus term alongside the Zernike
polynomial terms when fitting the  distortion of the surface map.

[Default: 1]

=item FIT_N_ORDER

Number of Zernike polynomial orders to use in fitting and subtracting
distortions from the surface map.

[Default: 2]

=item FIT_SEC_DIFF

Whether to attempt to fit the location of the secondary diffraction
pattern.  If true then the amplitude of the aperture map will be used
to allow the position of the outer minimum to be fitted.  This information
will be used during the phase correction step, prior to the extraction
of the phase map.  It also allows radial profiles to be produced.

When not fitting the diffraction pattern, phase corrections can be
applied first and then the amplitude and phase extracted together.

=item FIT_PANELS

Whether to fit adjustments of the dish panels in order to estimate
adjuster moves which could be made.

=item FIT_TERMS

This parameter allows specific Zernike polynomial terms
to be included in the surface distortion fitting.

For example: piston, tilt, tip and coma,
plus the custom defocus model, can be fitted with
the following parameters:

    FIT_N_ORDER=4
    FIT_TERMS=1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
    FIT_DEFOCUS=1

[Default: all terms up to the specified order]

=item MERGE_CHANNELS

Whether or not to merge the low and high gain channels.

If enabled (1) then maps will be made from both the low and high gain
channels.  These maps will then be merged so that the low gain channel
is used for the brighter regions (where the high gain channel saturates)
and the high gain channel in the less bright regions.

If disabled (0) then only the low gain channel will be used.

[Default: 1]

=item POINTING_OFFSET

Pointing correction to be applied when creating the initial pattern map.
If not specified then the pointing will be estimated automatically from
the phase of an initial pattern map made quickly from the low gain channel
only.

=item SHMULLUS_CONFIG

Configuration file to be passed to corresponding Shmullus tasks.
Some entries from the file are also read by the pipeline itself.

=item SUBTRACT_SEC_DIFF

Whether to subtract the secondary diffraction pattern at the phase
correction step.
