=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SCIENCE_LINEFOREST - Reduce an ACSIS lineforest science
observation using advanced algorithms.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe is used for advanced lineforest ACSIS data processing.

This recipe first creates a spatial cube from the raw time series
data. Then, working on the raw time series data, it subtracts a median
time-series signal, thresholds the data, then trims the ends of the
frequency range to remove high-noise regions.  There is optional
masking of noise spikes.  Receptors with non-linear baselines and
spectra affected by transient high-frequency noise may be rejected.

After the time-series manipulation has been done to every member of
the current group, every member is run through MAKECUBE to create a
group spatial cube. This cube then has its baseline removed through a
smoothing process, and moments maps are created for the full cube and
for each detected line.

A baseline mask formed from the group cube is run through UNMAKECUBE
to form baseline masks for the input time-series data, which are then
baselined. The baselined time-series data are then run through
MAKECUBE to create observation cubes, from which moments maps are
created.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This recipe is suitable for ACSIS data.

=item *

The 'nearest' method is used for creating cubes with MAKECUBE.

=item *

A 10-pixel box smooth is used in the frequency domain. This may be too
large for some narrow-line data.

The spatial smoothing has a five-pixel kernel.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 4

=item BASELINE_LINEARITY

If set to true (1) receptors with mostly or all non-linear baselines
are excluded from the reduced products.  [1]

=item BASELINE_LINEARITY_CLIP

This is used to reject receptors that have non-linear baselines.
It is the maximum number of standard deviations above the median rms
deviations for which a detector's non-linearity is regarded as
acceptable.  The minimum allowed is 2.  A comma-separated list will
perform iterative sigma clipping of outliers, but standard deviations
in the list should not decrease.  ["2.0,2.3,3.0"]

=item BASELINE_LINEARITY_LINEWIDTH

This is used to reject receptors that have transient or mostly
non-linear baselines.  It specifies the location of spectral-line
emission or the regions to analyse for bad baselines.  Allowed
values are:

=over 4

=item *

"auto", which requests that the emission be found automatically;

=item *

"base" meaning test the portions of the spectrum defined by
recipe parameter BASELINE_REGIONS; or

=item *

it is the extent(s) of the source spectral line(s) measured in km/s,
supplied in a comma-separated list.  For this last option, each range
may be given as bounds separated by a colon; or as a single value
being the width about zero.  For instance "-20:50" would excise the
region -20 to +50 km/s, and "30" would exclude the -15 to +15 km/s
range.

=back

["auto"]

=item BASELINE_LINEARITY_MINRMS

This is used to retain receptors that have noisy or slightly non-linear
baselines, or transient bad baselines (cf. LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE).
The parameter is the minimum rms deviation from linearity, measured in
antenna temperature, for a receptor to be flagged as bad.  The
non-linearity identification intercompares the receptors and can
reject an outlier that in practice is not a bad receptor; it is just
worse than the other receptors in an observation.  This parameter
sets an absolute lower limit to prevent such receptors from being
excluded.  Values between 0.05 and 0.2 are normal.  Most good
receptors will be in 0.02 to 0.05 range.  [0.1]

=item BASELINE_LINEARITY_SCALELENGTH

This is used to reject receptors that have non-linear baselines.  It
is the smoothing scale length in whole pixels.  Features narrower than
this are filtered out during the background-level determination.  It
should be should be odd (if an even value is supplied, the next higher
odd value will be used) and sufficiently large to remove the noise
while not removing the low-frequency patterns in the spectra.  The
minimum allowed is 51.  It is also used to detect transient non-linear
baselines (cf. LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE).  [101]

=item BASELINE_ORDER

The polynomial order to use when baselining cubes.  [1]

=item BASELINE_REGIONS

A comma-separated list of velocity ranges each in the format v1:v2, from
where the baseline should be estimated.  These can also be used to
define where to test baseline linearity if BASELINE_LINEARITY_LINEWIDTH
is set to "base".   [undef]

=item CHUNKSIZE

The maximum sum of file sizes in megabytes of files to process
simultaneously in MAKECUBE to avoid a timeout.  The choice is
affected by processor speed and memory.  The minimum allowed value
is 100.  [5120]

=item CREATE_MOMENTS_USING_SNR

If set to true (1), moments maps will be created using a
signal-to-noise map to find emission regions. This could be useful
when observations were taken under differing sky conditions and thus
have different noise levels.  [0]

=item CUBE_MAXSIZE

The maximum size, in megabytes, of the output cubes. This value does not
include extra information such as variance or weight arrays, FITS
headers, or any other NDF extensions.  [512]

=item CUBE_WCS

The coordinate system to regrid the cubes to.  If undefined, the
system is determined from the data.  [undef]

=item DESPIKE

If set to 1 (true) despiking of spectra is enabled.  [0]

=item DESPIKE_BOX

The size, in pixels, of the box used to both find the "background" and
for cleaning spikes.  This box should be slightly wider than the widest
expected spike.  Making this parameter too large will result in signal
being identified as a spike and thus masked out.  [5]

=item DESPIKE_CLIP

The clip standard deviations to use when finding spikes in the
background-subtracted RMS spectrum.  Multiple values result in
multiple clip levels.  A single clip level should be given verbatim,
(e.g. 3).  If supplying more than one level, enclose comma-separated
levels within square brackets (e.g. [3,3,5]).  ['[3,5]']

=item DESPIKE_PER_DETECTOR

Whether or not to treat each detector independently during despiking.
If a spike is not seen in all detectors, consider setting this
value to 1 (for true).  [0]

=item FINAL_LOWER_VELOCITY

Set a lower velocity over which the final products, such as the
reduced and binned spectral cubes, and noise and rms images, are to be
created.  Unlike RESTRICT_LOWER_VELOCITY, it permits the full
baselines to be used during processing, yet greatly reduces the
storage requirements of the final products by retaining only where the
astronomical signals reside.

It is typically used in conjunction with FINAL_UPPER_VELOCITY.  If
undefined, there is no lower limit.  If FINAL_UPPER_VELOCITY is also
undefined, the full velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends,
is used.  [undef]

=item FINAL_UPPER_VELOCITY

Set an upper velocity over which the final products, such as the
reduced and binned spectral cubes, and noise and rms images, are to be
created.  Unlike RESTRICT_UPPER_VELOCITY, it permits the full
baselines to be used during processing, yet greatly reduces the
storage requirements of the final products by retaining only where the
astronomical signals reside.

It is typically used in conjunction with FINAL_LOWER_VELOCITY.  If
undefined, there is no upper limit.  If FINAL_LOWER_VELOCITY is also
undefined, the full velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends,
is used.  [undef]

=item FLATFIELD

Whether or not to perform flat-fielding.  [0]

=item FLAT_LOWER_VELOCITY

The requested lower velocity for the flat-field estimations using the
sum or ratio methods.  It should be less than FLAT_LOWER_VELOCITY.
[undef]

=item FLAT_METHOD

When flat-fielding is required (cf. FLATFIELD parameter) this selects
the method used to derive the relative gains between receptors.  The
allowed selection comprises 'ratio', which finds the histogram peaks of
the ratio of voxel values; 'sum', which finds the integrated flux; and
'index', which searches and applies a calibration index of nightly
flat-field ratios.  The ratio method ought to work well using all the data,
but for some data, especially early observations, it has broken down as
the histogram mode is biased towards zero by noise and possible non-linearity
effects.  The sum method currently assumes that every receptor is
sampling the same signal, which is only approximately true.  ['sum']

=item FLAT_UPPER_VELOCITY

The requested upper velocity for the flat-field estimations using the
the sum or ratio methods.  It should be greater than
FLAT_LOWER_VELOCITY.  [undef]

=item FRACTION_BAD

The maximum fraction of bad values permitted in a receptor (or
receptor's subband for a hybrid observation) permitted before the
a receptor is deemed to be bad.  It must lie between 0.1 and 1.0
otherwise the default fraction is substituted.  [0.9]

=item FREQUENCY_SMOOTH

The number of channels to smooth in the frequency axis when smoothing
to determine baselines.  This number should be small (~10) for
narrow-line observations and large (~25) for broad-line
observations.  [10]

=item HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE

If set to true (1) the spectra for each receptor are analysed to
detect high-frequency interference noise, and those spectra deemed too
noisy are excluded from the reduced products.  [1]

=item HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_EDGE_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with high-frequency noise.  It is the
standard deviation to clip the summed-edginess profile iteratively in
order to measure the mean and standard deviation of the profile
unaffected by bad spectra.  A comma-separated list will perform
iterative sigma clipping of outliers, but standard deviations in the
list should not decrease.  ["2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0"]

=item HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE_THRESH_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with high-frequency noise.  This is the
number of standard deviations at which to threshold the noise profile
above its median level.  [4.0]

=item HIGHFREQ_RINGING

Whether or not to test for high-frequency ringing in the spectra. This
is where a band of spectra in the time series have the same
oscillation frequency and origin with smoothly varying amplitude over
time.  The amplitude is an order of magnitude or more lower than the
regular high-frequency interference, but because it extends over tens
to over 200 spectra, its affect can be as potent.

Even if set to 1 (true), at least HIGHFREQ_RINGING_MIN_SPECTRA
spectra are required to give a sufficient baseline against which to
detect spectra with ringing.  The HIGHFREQ_INTERFERENCE parameter
must be true to apply this filter.  [0]

=item HIGHFREQ_RINGING_MIN_SPECTRA

Minimum number of good spectra for ringing filtering to be attempted.
See HIGHFREQ_RINGING.  The filter needs to be able to discriminate
between the normal unaffected spectra from those with ringing.  The
value should be at least a few times larger than the number of
affected spectra.  Hence there is a minimum allowed value of 100.  The
default is an empirical guess; for the worst cases it will be too
small.  If there are insufficient spectra the filtering may still work
to some degree.  [400]

=item LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE

If set to true (1) the spectra for each receptor are analysed to
detect low-frequency interference ripples or bad baselines, and those
spectra deemed too deviant from linearity are excluded from the
reduced products.  [1]

=item LOWFREQ_INTERFERENCE_EDGE_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with low-frequency interference.  It is the
standard deviation to clip the profile of summed-deviations from linearity
iteratively in order to measure the mean and standard deviation of the profile
unaffected by bad spectra.  A comma-separated list will perform
iterative sigma clipping of outliers, but standard deviations in the
list should not decrease.  ["2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0"]

=item LOW_FREQ_INTERFERENCE_THRESH_CLIP

This is used to reject spectra with low-frequency interference.  This is the
number of standard deviations at which to threshold the non-linearity profile
above its median level.  [3.0]

=item MINIMUM_LINE_WIDTH

The minimum line width, in channels, of automatically detected lines.

=item MOMENTS

A comma-separated list of moments maps to create.  ["integ,iwc"]

=item MOMENTS_LOWER_VELOCITY

Set a lower velocity over which the moments maps are to be created.
It is typically used in conjunction with MOMENTS_UPPER_VELOCITY.  If
undefined, the full velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is
used.  [undef]

=item MOMENTS_UPPER_VELOCITY

Set an upper velocity over which the moments maps are to be created.
It is typically used in conjunction with MOMENTS_LOWER_VELOCITY.  If
undefined, the full velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is
used.  [undef]

=item PIXEL_SCALE

Pixel scale, in arcseconds, of cubes.  If undefined it is determined
from the data.  [undef]

=item REBIN

A comma-separated list of velocity resolutions to rebin the final cube
to.  If undefined, the observed resolution is used.  [undef]

=item RESTRICT_LOWER_VELOCITY

Trim all data to this lower velocity.  It is typically used in
conjunction with RESTRICT_UPPER_VELOCITY.  If undefined, the full
velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is used.  [undef]

=item RESTRICT_UPPER_VELOCITY

Trim all data to this upper velocity.  It is typically used in
conjunction with RESTRICT_LOWER_VELOCITY.  If undefined, the full
velocity range, less trimming of the noisy ends, is used.  [undef]

=item SPATIAL_SMOOTH

The number of pixels to smooth in both spatial axes when smoothing to
determine baselines.  [1]

=item SPREAD_METHOD

The method to use when spreading each input pixel value out between a
group of neighbouring output pixels when regridding cubes. See the
SPREAD parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for available spreading methods.
["nearest"]

=item SPREAD_WIDTH

The number of arcseconds on either side of the output position which
are to receive contributions from the input pixel. See the PARAMS
parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for more information.  [0]

=item SPREAD_FWHM_OR_ZERO

Depending on the spreading method, this parameter controls the number
of arcseconds at which the envelope of the spreading function goes to
zero, or the full-width at half-maximum for the Gaussian envelope. See
the PARAMS parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for more information.  [undef]

=item TILE

Whether or not to make tiled spectral cubes.  A true value (1)
performs tiling so as to restrict the data-processing resource
requirements.  Such tiled cubes abut each other in pixel co-ordinates
and may be pasted together to form the complete spectral cube.  [1]

=item TRIM_MINIMUM_OVERLAP

The minimum number of desired channels that should overlap after
trimming hybrid-mode observations.  If the number of overlapping
channels is fewer than this, then the fixed number of channels will be
trimmed according to the C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE>, C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE_LOWER>,
and C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE_UPPER> parameters.  [10]

=item TRIM_PERCENTAGE_LOWER

The percentage of the total frequency range to trim from the lower end
of the frequency range.  For example, if a cube has 1024 frequency
channels, and the percentage to trim is 10%, then 102 channels will be
trimmed from the lower end.  If it and C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE> are
undefined, the lower-end trimming defaults to 2.75% for ACSIS and 7.5%
for DAS observations.  [undef]

=item TRIM_PERCENTAGE

The percentage of the total frequency range to trim from either end.
For example, if a cube has 1024 frequency channels, and the percentage
to trim is 10%, then 102 channels will be trimmed from either end.
This parameter only takes effect if both C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE_LOWER> and
C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE_UPPER> are undefined.  If it too is undefined,
the upper-frequency trimming defaults to 2.75% for ACSIS and 7.5% for
DAS observations.  [undef]

=item TRIM_PERCENTAGE_UPPER

The percentage of the total frequency range to trim from the higher
end of the frequency range. For example, if a cube has 1024 frequency
channels, and the percentage to trim is 10%, then 102 channels will be
trimmed from the upper end.  If it and C<TRIM_PERCENTAGE> are undefined,
it defaults to 2.75% for ACSIS and 7.5% for DAS observations.  [undef]

=item VELOCITY_BIN_FACTOR

This is an integer factor by which the spectral axis may be compressed
by averaging adjacent channels. The rationale is to make the reduced
spectral cubes files substantially smaller; processing much faster;
and to reduce the noise so that, for example, emission features are
more easily identified and masked while determining the baselines.  It
is intended for ACSIS modes, such as BW250, possessing high spectral
resolution not warranted by the signal-to-noise.

Note that this compression is applied after any filtering of
high-frequency artefacts performed on adjacent channels.

A typical factor is 4.  There is no compression if this parameter is
undefined.  [undef]
