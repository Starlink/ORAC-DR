=head1 NAME

REDUCE_STANDARD - reduce a flux standard

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces a flux standard. It first performs quality
assurance tests, ascertaining whether the condition of the instrument
is suitable for any of the three HARP-based JCMT Legacy Surveys. It
then removes noisy frequency ends, merges hybrid-mode observations,
thresholds extreme signals, and removes any gross signal common to all
receptors. It then creates a cube, and removes a linear baseline.
Integrated and peak flux are then measured and compared with a
standard list.

This recipe is suitable for ACSIS data.
