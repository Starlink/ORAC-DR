REDUCE_SCIENCE_FSW_SUMMIT -  for unknown purposes.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This description appears to be copied from
REDUCE_SCIENCE_NARROWLINE. It may not be correct for this recipe.

This recipe is used for advanced narrow-line ACSIS data processing.

This recipe first creates a spatial cube from the raw time series
data. Then, working on the raw time series data, it subtracts a median
time-series signal, thresholds the data, then trims the ends of the
frequency range to remove high-noise regions.

After the time-series manipulation has been done to every member of
the current group, every member is run through MAKECUBE to create a
group spatial cube. This cube then has its baseline removed through a
smoothing process, and moments maps are created.

A baseline mask formed from the group cube is run through UNMAKECUBE
to form baseline masks for the input time-series data, which are then
baselined. The baselined time-series data are then run through
MAKECUBE to create observation cubes, from which moments maps are
created.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This recipe is suitable for ACSIS data.

=item *

The 'nearest' method is used for creating cubes with MAKECUBE.

=item *

A 10-pixel box smooth is used in the frequency domain. This may be too
large for some narrow-line data.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

For individual time-series data: median time-series removed with the
_tss suffix; thresholded data with the _thr suffix; frequency ends
removed with the _em suffix; baseline-only mask with the _tsmask
suffix; non-baseline regions masked with the _msk suffix; baselined
data with the _bl suffix.

=item *

For individual spatial/spectral cubes: baselined cube with the _cube
suffix; baseline region ma sk with the _blmask suffix.

=item *

For group cubes: cube with the _cube suffix; baseline region mask with
the _blmask suffix; baselined cube with the _bl suffix;

=item *

For moments maps: integrated intensity map with the _integ suffix;
velocity map with the _iwc suffix.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 4

=item BASELINE_ORDER

The polynomial order to use when baselining cubes.

=item CREATE_MOMENTS_USING_SNR

If set to true (1), moments maps will be created using a
signal-to-noise map to find emission regions. This could be useful
when observations were taken under differing sky conditions and thus
have different noise levels.

=item CUBE_WCS

The coordinate system to regrid the cubes to.

=item FLATFIELD

Whether or not to perform flat-fielding.

=item MOMENTS

A comma-separated list of moments maps to create.

=item MOMENTS_LOWER_VELOCITY

Set a lower velocity over which the moments maps are to be
created. Typically used in conjunction with
MOMENTS_UPPER_VELOCITY. Must include at least one decimal place
(i.e. "-50.0" for setting the limit to -50 km/s).

=item MOMENTS_UPPER_VELOCITY

Set an upper velocity over which the moments maps are to be
created. Typically used in conjunction with
MOMENTS_LOWER_VELOCITY. Must include at least one decimal place
(i.e. "50.0" for setting the limit to 50 km/s).

=item PIXEL_SCALE

Pixel scale, in arcseconds, of cubes.

=item REBIN

A comma-separated list of velocity resolutions to rebin the final cube
to.

=item RESTRICT_LOWER_VELOCITY

Trim all data to this lower velocity. Must include at least one
decimal place (i.e. "-50.0" for restricting to -50 km/s).

=item RESTRICT_UPPER_VELOCITY

Trim all data to this upper velocity. Must include at least one
decimal place (i.e. "100.0" for restricting to 100 km/s).

=item SPREAD_METHOD

The method to use when spreading each input pixel value out between a
group of neighbouring output pixels when regridding cubes. See the
SPREAD parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for available spreading methods.

=item SPREAD_WIDTH

The number of arcseconds on either side of the output position which
are to receive contributions from the input pixel. See the PARAMS
parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for more information.

=item SPREAD_FWHM_OR_ZERO

Depending on the spreading method, this parameter controls the number
of arcseconds at which the envelope of the spreading function goes to
zero, or the full-width at half-maximum for the Gaussian envelope. See
the PARAMS parameter in SMURF/MAKECUBE for more information.
