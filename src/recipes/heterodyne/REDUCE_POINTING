=head1 NAME

REDUCE_POINTING -- Reduce an ACSIS pointing observation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces an ACSIS pointing observation. It does so by first
converting a time-series cube (or more than one, as the case may be)
as written by the ACSIS specwriter into a spatial/spectral cube. This
cube is then median collapsed using the central 80% of the spectral
range to avoid edge noise. The pointing target is then located and
centroided to find the pointing offset in arcseconds.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

This recipe is suitable for ACSIS using either the RxA3i or HARP
backends, or DAS data converted to ACSIS format.  It reduces hybrid
pointing observations too.

=item *

By default the created cube has AzEl spatial co-ordinates.

=item *

Image sideband data from sideband-separating (2SB) receivers is not
processed.  This is because only data from the pointing receptor is
processed.  As this receptor will be associated with the main sideband,
it will not appear in subsystems associated with the image sideband.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

A spatial/spectral cube whose filename is of the form
aYYYYMMDD_NNNNN_SS_MMMM_cube.sdf, where YYYYMMDD is the UT date, NNNNN
is the zero-padded observation number, SS is the zero-padded subsystem
number, and MMMM is the first zero-padded sub-scan number for the
given observation and subsystem.

=item *

A collapsed "white light" image whose filename is of the form
aYYYYMMDD_NNNNN_SS_MMMM_col.sdf, where YYYYMMDD, NNNNN, SS, and MMMM
are as described above.
