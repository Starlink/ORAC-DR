=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SCIENCE_LEGACY - Reduces an ACSIS narrow-line science
observation using advanced algorithms for the tiled public release.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe is used for advanced narrow-line ACSIS data processing
forming spectral cubes for all JSA (HEALPix) tiles included within the
sky region observed.  Products are named to distinguish them from
normal reduced cubes.  (See OUTPUT DATA below.)  Otherwise it performs
the F<REDUCE_SCIENCE_NARROWLINE> recipe.  Please see the documentation
for that recipe for further information.


=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

For individual spatial/spectral cubes: baselined cube with the _cube
suffix; baseline region mask with the _blmask suffix.

=item *

For group cubes: cube with the _healpixE<lt>nE<gt> suffix, where
E<lt>nE<gt> is the HEALPix tile index.
