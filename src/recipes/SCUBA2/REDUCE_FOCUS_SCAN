=head1 NAME

REDUCE_FOCUS - Recipe for deriving pointing information

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe combines images from a focus observation, removes sky
emission and corrects for extinction before calculating the offsets in
millimetres from the nominal (0,0) position. A .ok flag file is
written to indicate to the online POINTING_FOCUS task that processing
is complete. For its own record keeping, the recipe also makes its own
estimate of the best-fit focus position which is written to a log
file.

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

This recipe is designed to operate in QUICK LOOK mode where each input
Frame object corresponds to one file. A further limitation is that the
recipe will only work if the data are processed by one focus position
at a time. Allowing the observation to finish and then beginning the
processing will cause this recipe to fail as the mosaicking steps
cannot adequately filter out data for different focus positions.
