=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SCAN_EXTENDED_SOURCE - Recipe for processing SCAN data from extended sources

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the recipe for processing SCAN data for extended
(e.g. Galactic) sources. The makemap configuration file is tuned to
best deal with such data.

Raw data are passed to the map maker which are processed to produce a
Frame image, which is then calibrated and displayed. A new Group image
is created and displayed. The noise properties of the new Group image
are calculated and written to a log file, C<log.noise>.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

The current noise level is stored in C<log.noise>.

=item *

The iterative map-maker (C<METHOD=ITER>) is the preferred imaging
tool, but it works best when all data from an observation are present
(including the bracketing dark frames).

=item *

For large amounts of data this recipe will spend a long time not
updating the ORAC-DR output. Check to see that C<makemap> is still
processing by running C<top> or C<ps>.

=item *

Alternative configuration parameters for the iterative map-maker may
be specified using the recipe parameters outlined below.

=item *

The output map is calibrated in units of mJy/arcsec**2.

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is displayed in Gaia window 1.

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 2

=item MAKEMAP_CONFIG

Name of a config file for use with the SMURF makemap task. The file
must exist in the current working directory or C<$ORAC_DATA_OUT>.
