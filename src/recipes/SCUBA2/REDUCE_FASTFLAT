REDUCE_FASTFLAT - Process fast-ramp flatfield data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Process fast-ramp flatfield data associated with science
observations. The fast-ramp flatfields for a given science observation
are reduced in turn and compared with one another to see how much the
flatfield solution changes over the duration of an observation.

See L<REDUCE_FLATFIELD|REDUCE_FLATFIELD> for further details.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

This recipe only works with raw time-series data.

=head1 DISPLAY

The results for each subarray are displayed in a separate Kapview
window.

The results displayed are:

=over 2

=item *

Current responsivity solution (top left panel)

=item *

Previous responsivity solution, using same colour scale as the current
solution (top right panel)

=item *

Percentage change in responsivities (bottom right panel)

=item *

Histograms of current and previous responsivities, displayed over the
same range (left and right bottom left panels respectively)
