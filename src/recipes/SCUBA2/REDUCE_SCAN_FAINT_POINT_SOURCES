=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SCAN_FAINT_POINT_SOURCES - Recipe for processing SCAN data from faint compact sources

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the recipe for processing SCAN data for faint compact
sources. The makemap configuration file is tuned to best deal with
such data, though the user may specify their own.

Raw data are passed to the map maker which are processed to produce a
Frame image, which is calibrated and displayed. The noise is estimated
and a Frame NEFD is calculated. Once all the individual observations
have been processed, a new Group image is created and displayed. This
image is processed with a matched filter to enhance the
signal-to-noise ratio of point sources. The noise properties and NEFD
for the new Group image are calculated and written to log files.

=head1 NOTES

The iterative map-maker (C<METHOD=ITER>) is the preferred imaging
tool, but it works best when all data from an observation are present
(including the bracketing dark frames).

The noise level and NEFD are stored in C<log.noise> and C<log.nefd>
respectively. The noise and NEFD are calculated for each Frame image
as well as for the final Group image (after processing with the
matched filter).

Alternative configuration parameters for the iterative map-maker may
be specified using the recipe parameters outlined below.

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is displayed in Gaia window 1.

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 4

=item MAKEMAP_CONFIG

Name of a config file for use with the SMURF makemap task. The file
must exist in the current working directory or C<$ORAC_DATA_OUT>.
