=head1 NAME

REDUCE_POINTING - Process POINTING observations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe combines images from a POINTING observation, removes sky
emission and corrects for extinction before calculating the offsets in
Azimuth and Elevation from the nominal (0,0) position. The recipe also
determines the beam size and the flux conversion factor (FCF) and
writes them to log files.

The image is processed with a matched filter before estimating the
pointing offsets, but this output is not retained on disk. The reduced
product remains the coadd.

For additional record keeping, the source position is fitted and
offsets in Azimuth and Elevation from the nominal (0,0) position are
derived and logged. Note, however, that these may not be identical to
those derived by the telescope POINTING_FOCUS task.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

The pointing offsets, beam size and FCF are written to the log files
C<log.pointing>, C<log.beam> and C<log.fcf>.

=item *

This recipe deals with both the 2-D DA-processed images and the time
series data. Primitives which are meant for 2-D images are no-ops for
time-series data.

=item *

The pointing offsets are calculated from the centroid position and a
fit to the source.

=head1 DISPLAY

The coadd is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is displayed in
window 3.
