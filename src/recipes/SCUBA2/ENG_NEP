=head1 NAME

ENG_NEP - Process NEP measurements made in engineering mode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe processes NOISE observations taken at various settings for
the pixel heater and detector bias. The noise properties are
calculated over a given frequency range and the resulting
noise-equivalent power (NEP) data for each subarray are combined into
a 4-d hypercube of the NEP as a function of bolometer position, heater
and detector bias value.

In addition the effective and RMS NEPs are calculated for each
subarray and heater/bias setting. The results are written as an image
with heater values along the x-axis and bias values along the y-axis.

The RMS NEP is calculated for a varying number of bolometers (the N
best-performing, where N varies between the values defined below) and
is used to compute the array mapping speed, N/(NEP_RMS)**2.

Details are written to log files: the noise properties are written to
C<log.bolonoise> as for regular noise observations, while the mapping
speeds are written to C<log.mapspeed_SUB> where C<SUB> is the subarray
label (s4a, s4b etc, one log file per subarray).

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item MAPSPEED_NBOLEN

Maximum number of bolometers to use in mapping speed
calculation. Default is 1000.

=item MAPSPEED_NBOLST

Minimum number of bolometers to use in mapping speed
calculation. Defaults is 300.

=item MAPSPEED_STEP

Interval in the number of bolometers to use in mapping speed
calculation. Default is 100.

=item NEP_MAX

Maximum NEP to be used in calculating the NEP images (W
Hz**-0.5). Default is 2.0e-14 W Hz**-0.5.

=item NEP_MIN

Minimum NEP to be used in calculating the NEP images (W
Hz**-0.5). Default is 2.0e-17 W Hz**-0.5.

=item NOISE_FREQRANGE

A pair of comma-separated values indicating the lower and upper
frequency bounds (in Hz) to be used in the calculation of the noise
properties. Default is 2,10 Hz.
