=head1 NAME

ENG_NEP - Recipe for processing engineering data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe processed NOISE observations taken at various settings for
the pixel heater and detector bias. The noise properties are
calculated over one or more frequency ranges and the resulting NEP
data for each subarray are combined into a 4-d hypercube of the NEP as
a function of bolometer, heater and detector bias value.

In addition the effective and RMS noise-equivalent power (NEP) is
calculated for each subarray and heater/bias setting. The results are
written as an image with heater values along the x-axis and bias
values along the y-axis.

The RMS NEP is calculated for a varying number of bolometers (the N
best-performing, where N varies from 300 to 1000) and is used to
compute the array mapping speed, N/(NEP_RMS)**2.

Details are written to log files: the basic noise properties are
written to C<log.bolonoise> as for regular noise observations, while
the mapping speeds are written to C<log.mapspeed_SUB> where C<SUB> is
the subarray label (s4a, s4b etc, one log file per subarray).

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 4

=item NOISE_FREQRANGE

One or more pairs of colon-separated values indicating the lower and
upper frequency bounds to be used in the calculation of the noise
properties. Multiple ranges can be given, separated by commas. (For
example, NOISE_FREQRANGE = 0.3:2,2:10.)
