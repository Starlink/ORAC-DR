=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SCAN_CHECKRMS - Process SCAN-mode data and collect noise/NEFD statistics

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe performs noise and map-making processing on raw time
series data in order to derive a number of performance parameters for
comparison with predictions from the SCUBA-2 integration time
calculator (ITC).

The mean NEP for each subarray is derived from the full
timeseries. The average of these values is quoted as the value
C<NEP_AV>.

Raw data are passed to the map maker which are processed using the
default config file (unless the source is a calibrator) to produce a
an image. FCFs are derived if the source is a calibrator. The image is
calibrated in mJy/beam using the default FCF.

The recipe calculates the elapsed time of the observation and stores
the mean zenith optical depth (at 225 GHz and the current wavelength),
line-of-sight transmission and elevation. The NEP data are converted
to an NEFD (using the transmission and default FCF) and, using an
effective exposure time derived from the ITC, an equivalent image noise.

The noise, NEFD and mean exposure time (per pixel) are derived from
the calibrated image. RMS noise and NEFD values are predicted using
the ITC and a warning issued if the measured noise exceeds the
expected value by more than 20 %.

All values are written to a log file called C<log.checkrms>.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

Only default noise processing is supported.

=item *

The user may specify alternate makemap config files, but be aware that
the same config will be used for every observation.

=item *

Non-standard PONG map sizes will yield no results from the ITC.

=item *

Undefined values appear as C<NaN> in the log file.

=item *

The recipe does B<not> coadd the data; results are written to the log
file for each separate observation.

=item *

Only the reduced map files (one for each observation) are kept at the
end of processing.
