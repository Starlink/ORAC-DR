=head1 NAME

ARRAY_TESTS - Basic recipe to co-add and display DREAM/STARE images

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Basic processing recipe suitable for DREAM/STARE images from a single
subarray. This recipe is designed to be used for lab-testing only.

No alignment is done on the images so that they are mosaicked in the
pixel frame (this means that if data exists from multiple subarrays,
they will be averaged together!). A method to determine the
frame-to-frame variance is provided which writes out to a log file
called C<log.noise> which can be monitored by the StripChart. The
relevant column to monitor is C<noise>.

=head1 NOTES

This primitive is not designed to handle time series observing modes.

If the frames are identical, then the Group mosaicked image with
contain C<nan>. In that case, add the argument GENVAR=0 to
_MAKE_MOSAIC_FRAME_.

If there is no variance, C<nan> will be written to C<log.noise>. The
stripchart may or may not do something sensible with that.

The Group image variance is written to C<log.noise> for monitoring
with the StripChart.

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is displayed in Gaia window 1.

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.
