REDUCE_SCAN_SUMMIT - Summit recipe for processing SCAN data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe processes SCAN data with the iterative map-maker in the
summit pipeline. This recipe makes use of a percentage completion
parameter which delays the map-making step until a certain proportion
of the data exist on disk.

Flatfielded data are passed to the iterative map maker to produce a
Frame image, which is then calibrated and displayed. A new Group image
is created and displayed. The noise properties of the new Group image
are calculated and written to a log file, C<log.noise>.

Control in this recipe is handled by a series of Frame and Group uhdr
flags. These are NOCALIB, OBSEND, PERCENT_CMP and TCS_INDEX (Frame)
and LAST_INDEX and MAPMADE (Group). The TCS_INDEX and LAST_INDEX
values are used to determine if the scan pattern has been completed
since the last map was made. OBSEND is used to decide whether or not
to create a new Group coadd. The NOCALIB flag is used to bypass the
calibration step as raw timeseries data should not be calibrated.

The PERCENT_CMP entry is specified in this recipe as an argument to
_PROCESS_SCAN_DATA_. However, it is only used for observations which
consist of a single pass of the scan pattern.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

The noise level estimated from the current Group file is stored in
C<log.noise>.

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is displayed in Gaia window 1 (though no image will be
displayed until the percentage completion or change in TCS index
criteria are satisfied).

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.
