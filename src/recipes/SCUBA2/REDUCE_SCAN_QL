=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SCAN_QL - QL process SCAN data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe processes SCAN data from the quick-look pipeline. Raw data
are passed to the iterative map-maker with QL-optimized configuration
parameters to produce a Frame image, which is then calibrated and
displayed. FCFs are derived if the source is a calibrator. The Frame
image is coadded to the existing Group image, and the new Group image
is displayed. The noise properties of the new Group image are
calculated and written to a log file, C<log.noise>.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

The current noise level is stored in C<log.noise>.

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is displayed in Gaia window 1.

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.

# Create image to analyze - use the iterative map-maker for best
# results. Sky removal and extinction correction are handled here too.
_QLMAKEMAP_FRAME_

# Derive FCFs if this is a calibrator - the image is trimmed and has a
# background subtracted before calculating FCFs. However, the original
# file created by _QLMAKEMAP_FRAME_ is stored again on completion.

# Delete any temporary files, keeping only the current files and

# not be deleted because it is never replaced by anything so will
