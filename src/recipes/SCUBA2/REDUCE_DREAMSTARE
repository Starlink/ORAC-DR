=head1 NAME

REDUCE_DREAMSTARE - Recipe for processing DREAM/STARE images

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Basic processing recipe suitable for DREAM/STARE images. Input data
from the individual subarrays are combined to produce a single mosaic
for each time step. Sky removal and extinction correction take place
on these images before they are combined into a single Frame image.

The Frame image is calibrated and displayed, before being combined
with the Group image in a running average. The noise properties of the
new Group image are calculated and logged, and the image searched for
sources.

=head1 NOTES

This primitive can not handle time series data.

The current noise level is stored in C<log.noise>, the positions and
fluxes of any sources are stored in C<log.flux>.

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is displayed in Gaia window 1.

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.
