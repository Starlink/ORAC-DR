=head1 NAME

REDUCE_POINTING - Recipe for deriving pointing information

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe combines images from a DREAM/STARE POINTING observation,
removes sky emission and corrects for extinction before calculating
the offsets in Azimuth and Elevation from the nominal (0,0)
position. Since the pointing will be measured on a point source, the
recipe also determines the beam size and the flux conversion factor
(FCF).

For additional record keeping, the source position is fitted and
offsets in Azimuth and Elevation from the nominal (0,0) position are
derived and logged. Note, however, that these may not be identical to
those derived by the POINTING_FOCUS task. Since the pointing will be
measured on a point source, the recipe also determines the beam size
and the flux conversion factor (FCF), which are also written to their
respective log files.

=head1 NOTES

The pointing offsets, beam size and FCF are written to the log files
C<log.pointing>, C<log.beam> and C<log.fcf>.

This recipe deals with the 2-D DA-processed images, not the time
series data.

The pointing offsets can be calculated from the centroid position or
from a fit to the source: see the C<METHOD> parameter for
_FIND_POINTING_OFFSETS_. The default is to determine the centroid.

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is not displayed.

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.
