=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SKYDIP

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Placeholder recipe for processing skydip observations.

=head1 NOTES

Since no skydip primitives exist, this recipe fills the time by
calculating the noise.

=head1 DISPLAY

Displays the current noise image(s).

# Standard introduction
_SCUBA2_HELLO_

# As an interim measure before skydip processing is in place, use the
# spare CPU cycles to calculate the noise as each elevation is
# essentially a NOISE-SKY observation.

# Determine an NEFD estimate from the noise measurements
