=head1 NAME

QUICK_LOOK_LAB - Basic recipe to co-add and display DREAM/Stare images

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Basic processing recipe suitable for DREAM/STARE images. No alignment
is done on the images so that they are mosaicked in the pixel frame. A
method to determine the frame-to-frame variance is provided which
writes out to an ORAC Index file called log.noise which can be
monitored by the stripchart. The relevant column to monitor is
`noise'.

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

This primitive is not designed to handle time series observing modes,
but it won't tell you that.

If the frames are identical, then the Group mosaicked image with
contain `nan'. In that case, add the argument GENVAR=0 to
_MAKE_MOSAIC_FRAME_.

If there is no variance, `nan' will be written to log.noise. The
stripchart may or may not do something sensible with that.
