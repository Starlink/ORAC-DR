REDUCE_SCAN_JSA_PUBLIC - Form observation tiles for the public co-add

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a recipe to process SCUBA-2 SCAN data to create per-observation
JSA (HEALPix) tiles.  The map maker is called with the JSATILES parameter
enabled and with the generic CONFIG file suitable for the JSA public
co-added products.

It is based on, and performs the first few steps of, the F<REDUCE_SCAN>
recipe but with the adjustments mentioned above.  Please see the
documentation for that recipe for further information.

# Create previews of all of the separate tiles (for testing purposes).
# This primitive will only be active if TILE_PREVIEWS is turned on,

# This recipe produces observation products only, therefore no
