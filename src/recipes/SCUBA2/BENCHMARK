=head1 NAME

BENCHMARK - Basic benchmarking recipe

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Basic realistic recipe suitable for benchmarking tests. Processes
DREAM/STARE images. The quantity of data should always be the same so
as to obtain meaningful comparisons.

No images are displayed - this is purely a timing test for processing
a standard quantity of data.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

This primitive can not handle time series observing modes.

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

None.
