=head1 NAME

REDUCE_NOISE - Process NOISE observations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The recipe calculates the average power spectrum for each array,
displaying each in a separate window, before calculating the white
noise properties (and noise equivalent power). The noise properties
are written to a log file, C<log.bolonoise>. The array mapping speed
is calculated and written to a log file called
C<log.mapspeed_SUBARRAY>.

The results are displayed in a Kapview window.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

This recipe only works with raw time-series data.

=item *

Noise properties are written to C<log.bolonoise>, and mapping speeds
are written to C<log.mapspeed_SUB> where C<SUB> is the subarray.

=head1 DISPLAY

One Kapview window is used to display the average power spectra for
each subarray.

The focal-plane noise map and histogram are shown in a separate
Kapview window, along with maps of the NEP and the percentage-change
in the noise.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the -recpars option:

=over 2

=item RESIST_CFG

Name of an alternative list of resistor values used when calculating
the flatfield. File must be in ORAC_DATA_OUT.
