=head1 NAME

REDUCE_NOISE - Basic recipe for reducing NOISE observations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Basic processing recipe suitable for NOISE observations. The bolometer
power spectra are calculated and the relative power at two
(user-specifiable) frequencies is calculated. If this ratio exceeds a
critical value, defined by the MASKVAL parameter below, the bolometer
is marked as bad.

The outcome of this recipe is a noise image and bad-bolometer mask for
each subarray which is stored in the calibration system.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

This recipe only works with raw time-series data.

=item *

See the documentation for _CREATE_BAD_BOLO_MASK_ for further
parameters which may be specified to determine bad bolometers.

=item *

Bad-bolometer mask file names are stored in C<index.mask>.

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

None.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 2

=item BESTBOL_PERCENT

The number of bolometers expressed as a percentage which should be
used to create a bad-bolometer mask.
