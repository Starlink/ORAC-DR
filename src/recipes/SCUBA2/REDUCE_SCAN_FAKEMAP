=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SCAN_FAKEMAP - Process SCAN data with existing map data added

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe processes SCAN data with data from an existing map added
to the input timeseries. Raw data are passed to the map maker which
are processed to produce a Frame image, which is then calibrated. A
new Group image is created and displayed.

The user provides the name of a template input map from which a fake
map is created with the pixel bounds which match those of the map
created with SCUBA-2 data alone. The input map may be shifted on the
sky relative to its nominal centre position to avoid overlap with
sources in the SCUBA-2 data, and may be regridded to match the pixel
size of the output map.

Alternatively, the recipe can optionally create a Gaussian of a given
FWHM and unit amplitude, though only at the map centre (in pixel
coordinates).

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

For large amounts of data this recipe will spend a long time not
updating the ORAC-DR output. Check to see that C<makemap> is still
processing by running C<top> or C<ps>.

=item *

Alternative configuration parameters for the iterative map-maker may
be specified using the recipe parameters outlined below.

=head1 DISPLAY

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 2

=item FAKEMAP_FWHM

FWHM in arcsec of Gaussian to use as input map. Only used if
C<FAKEMAP_MAP> is unspecified.

=item FAKEMAP_MAP

Name of the map to add to the raw timeseries. The file must be an NDF
and exist in the current working directory or C<$ORAC_DATA_OUT>.

=item FAKEMAP_SCALE

The value by which to scale the input map before adding to the
timeseries. Default is 1.0 (no scaling). Equivalent of the C<makemap>
parameter C<fakescale>.

=item FAKEMAP_REGRID

A flag to denote whether the fake map should be regridded to the same
pixel scale as the output map. Default is 0 (false).

=item FAKEMAP_OFFSET

RA, Dec offsets in arcsec which specify how much the map coordinates
should be adjusted before adding to the map. If only one value is
given, the same will be used for both axes. Default is 0,0 (no shift).

=item MAKEMAP_CONFIG

Name of a config file for use with the SMURF makemap task. The file
must exist in the current working directory, C<$MAKEMAP_CONFIG_DIR> or
C<$ORAC_DATA_OUT>.
