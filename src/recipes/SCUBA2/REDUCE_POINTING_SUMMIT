=head1 NAME

REDUCE_POINTING_SUMMIT - Process POINTING observations in the summit pipeline

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe processes data from a POINTING observation in the SUMMIT
pipeline.

For DREAM/STARE, the images from the individual subarrays are
combined, sky emission removed (assuming a simple DC offset) and
corrected for extinction.

SCAN-mode data are passed to the iterative map-maker. Fast-ramp
flatfield files are processed and stored so the iterative map-maker
can use them.

The image is cropped to 150 arcsec on a side, and if the source is a
known calibrator, the pipeline calculates FCFs. The map is then
calibrated and tagged as a reduced product.

For additional record keeping, the source position is fitted and
offsets in Azimuth and Elevation from the nominal (0,0) position are
derived and logged. Note, however, that these may not be identical to
those derived by the telescope POINTING_FOCUS task.

This recipe is largely the same as L<REDUCE_POINTING|REDUCE_POINTING>
with minor modifications specific to handle data as they are taken.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

The pointing offsets, beam size and FCF are written to the log files
C<log.pointing>, C<log.beam> and C<log.fcf>.

=item *

Fast-ramp flatfield data are processed and results written to the log
file C<log.flatfield>.

=item *

This recipe deals with both the 2-D DA-processed images and the time
series data. Primitives which are meant for 2-D images are no-ops for
time-series data.

=item *

The pointing offsets are calculated from the centroid position and a
fit to the source. They are written into the output file as a
C<JCMT::Pointing> extension.

=head1 DISPLAY

The coadd is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is displayed in
window 3.
