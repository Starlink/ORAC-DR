REDUCE_FOCUS - Recipe for deriving pointing information

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe combines images from a focus observation, removes sky
emission and corrects for extinction before calculating the offsets in
millimetres from the nominal (0,0) position. A .ok flag file is
written to indicate to the online POINTING_FOCUS task that processing
is complete. For its own record keeping, the recipe also makes its own
estimate of the best-fit focus position which is written to a log
file.

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

This recipe is designed to operate in QUICK LOOK mode, and thus deals
with the 2-D DA-processed images, not the time series data. A further
limitation is that the recipe will only work if the data are processed
by one focus position at a time. Allowing the observation to finish
and then beginning the processing will cause this recipe to fail as
the mosaicking steps cannot adequately filter out data for different
focus positions.
