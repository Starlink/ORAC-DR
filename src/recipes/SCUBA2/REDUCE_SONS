REDUCE_SONS - Process data for the SONS project

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the recipe for processing data taken for the SCUBA-2 Survey of
Nearby Stars (SONS).

This recipe processes SCAN data, making a map from files that meet a
given noise criterion, and uses a jack-knife method to remove residual
low-spatial frequency noise and create an optimal matched-filtered
output map. The recipe proceeds as follows:

=over 2

=item *

The noise properties for each 30-second subscan are calculated, and
those files which exceed 1.5 times the mean are excluded from the
map-making stage.

=item *

Each observation is processed twice using the specified parameters,
the second time with an artificial point source added to the
timeseries, to create a signal map and an effective PSF image.

=item *

These images are coadded (like with like) to produce a total signal
map and a total effective PSF image. The amplitude of the source in
the effective PSF image is compared with the input value to assess the
effect the map-making process has on a point source. This ratio is
used to scale the FCF later when calibrating the data.

=item *

The observations are divided into two groups which are coadded
separately. These coadds are subtracted from one another to create the
C<jack-knife> map.

=item *

The angular power spectrum of the jack-knife map (which should consist
purely of noise) is calculated and used to remove residual low-spatial
frequency noise from the signal map and the effective PSF. This is the
so-called C<whitening> step (because it produces a map which has a
noise power spectrum that is white).

=item *

The data are calibrated in mJy/beam using a corrected FCF.

=item *

The whitened signal map is processed with a matched filter using the
whitened PSF image as the PSF.

=item *

The jack-knife map is also whitened and processed with the matched
filter. This map should consist purely of noise.

=item *

Signal-to-noise ratio maps are created for the filtered versions of
the signal map and the jack-knife map.

=back

The outcome (the match-filtered whitened signal map) should be the
optimal map with white noise properties. This is the map to be used
for science goals.

This recipe generates a large number of output files. There will be
two for each observation (the signal map and the effective PSF map), a
total signal coadd, an effective PSF coadded from all the individual
effective PSF maps, a jackknife map, a whitened signal map, a
calibrated whitened signal map, a matched-filtered calibrated whitened
signal map and a signal-to-noise ratio map created from it.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

This recipe should only be given data for a single source, and a
single field.

=item *

An even number of observations will be used to create the jack-knife
map.

=item *

Alternative configuration parameters for the iterative map-maker may
be specified using the recipe parameters outlined below.

=item *

This recipe may be called via the shorter name C<FAINT_POINT_SOURCES_JACKKNIFE>.

=item *

For large amounts of data this recipe will spend a long time not
updating the ORAC-DR window. Check to see that C<makemap> is still
processing by running C<top> or C<ps>. (Running with -log sf is
recommended.)

=head1 DISPLAY

None.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 2

=item FAKEMAP_CONSTSNR

A flag to scale the gaussian in amplitude by the square-root of the
number of maps to be created by the recipe so that the signal-to-noise
ratio of the final map-filtered PSF is independent of the number of
observations. Default is 1.

=item FAKEMAP_FWHM

FWHM (in arcsec) of a gaussian to add to the timeseries. Default is to
use the appropriate telescope main beam FWHM.

=item FAKEMAP_OFFSET

The offsets (in arcsec) to apply to the fake source added to the
timeseries. If one value is given, it will be used for both
axes. Default is to apply no shift.

=item FAKEMAP_SCALE

Amplitude of the fake source (in Jy/beam) added to the timeseries to
assess the map-making response to a point source. Default is 10/50
Jy/beam at 850/450 um respectively.

=item MAKEMAP_CONFIG

Name of a config file for use with the SMURF makemap task. The file
must exist in the current working directory, C<$MAKEMAP_CONFIG_DIR>,
C<$ORAC_DATA_OUT>, C<$ORAC_DATA_CAL> or C<$STARLINK_DIR/share/smurf>.

=item MAKEMAP_PIXSIZE

Pixel size in arcsec for the output map. Default is wavelength
dependent (4 arcsec at 850 um, 2 arcsec at 450 um). Note that the
timeseries will be downsampled to match this scale during the
map-making process.

=item PSF_BOX

Size of square region (in pixels) use to define effective PSF.

=item SUBSCAN_ESTIMATOR

Estimator for calculating the noise properties of each
subscan. Supported values are C<WTNEP> (not for B<METHOD>=C<MAP>),
C<MEAN>, C<MEDIAN> and C<SIGMA> (B<METHOD>=C<MAP> only). Default is
C<SIGMA> (or C<MEDIAN> if B<METHOD> is not C<MAP>).

=item SUBSCAN_METHOD

Method for determining the noise properties. Supported values are C<FREQHI>,
C<FREQLO> and C<MAP>. Default is C<MAP>.

=item WHITEN_BOX

Size of the region used to calculate the angular power spectrum for
removing residual low-frequency noise in the data. Default is a square
region bounded by the noise being less than twice the minimum value.
