=head1 NAME

REDUCE_SCAN - Process SCAN-mode data

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the default recipe for processing SCAN data. Raw data are
passed to the map maker which are processed to produce a Frame image,
which is calibrated and displayed. FCFs are derived if the source is a
calibrator. A new Group image is created and displayed after all the
individual observations have been processed. The noise properties of
the new Group image are calculated and written to a log file,
C<log.noise>.

Flux conversion factors are derived if the source is a calibrator.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

The noise level in the Group coadd is stored in C<log.noise>.

=item *

For large amounts of data this recipe will spend a long time not
updating the ORAC-DR output. Check to see that C<makemap> is still
processing by running C<top> or C<ps>.

=item *

Alternative configuration parameters for the iterative map-maker may
be specified using the recipe parameters outlined below.

=head1 DISPLAY

The Frame image is displayed in Gaia window 1.

The Group image is displayed in Gaia window 2; its variance is
displayed in window 3.

=head1 AVAILABLE PARAMETERS

The following recipe parameters can be set via the --recpars option:

=over 2

=item MAKEMAP_CONFIG

Name of a config file for use with the SMURF makemap task. The file
must exist in the current working directory, C<$MAKEMAP_CONFIG_DIR> or
C<$ORAC_DATA_OUT>.
