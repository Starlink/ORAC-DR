REDUCE_NOISE_QL - Quick-look recipe for reducing NOISE observations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Basic processing recipe suitable for NOISE observations in the
quick-look pipeline. Each subarray is handled separately. The average
bolometer power spectrum is calculated and displayed, as is the noise
and NEP properties. The NEP values are used to create a bad bolometer
mask. At the end of the observation, the average noise properties are
determined by averaging the noise and NEP data and analyzing those
images.

The outcome of this recipe is a noise image and bad-bolometer mask for
each subarray which is stored in the calibration system.

=head1 NOTES

=over 2

=item *

This recipe only works with raw time-series data.

=item *

Bad-bolometer mask file names are stored in C<index.mask>.

=back

=head1 DISPLAY

The average bolometer power spectrum is displayed in a Kapview
window. The noise map and corresponding histogram are displayed in a
different Kapview window (each subarray is displayed in different
window).
