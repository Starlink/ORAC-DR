# Name:
#    SKY_AND_JITTER_APHOT

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a "combined jitter" photometry observation, and
#    performs aperture photometry.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "combined jitter" photometry observation
#    with UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation
#    comprising one or more sets of frames, each set containing a sky
#    frame, followed by jittered object frames; and a pre-determined
#    flat-field frame to make a calibrated, trimmed mosaic automatically.

#    This recipe performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, sky
#    subtraction, flat-field division, feature detection and matching
#    between object frames, and resampling.  See the "Notes" for details.

#    Photometry of the point source using a fixed 5-arcsecond aperture
#    is calculated for each jitter frame and the mosaic.  The results
#    appear in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/aphot_results.txt in the form of a Starlink
#    small text list.  The analysis of each star is appended to this file.

#    This recipe is suitable for moderately faint point sources.

# Notes:
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  You may use SKY_FLAT or SKY_FLAT_MASKED to make the flat field.
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The most-recent sky frame is used for the sky subtraction.
#    -  Where automatic registration is not possible, the recipe matches
#    the centroid of central source, and should that fail, it resorts
#    to using the telescope offsets transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaic by applying offsets in intensity to
#    give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is trimmed to the dimensions of an input frame.  The
#    mosaic is not normalised by its exposure time (that being the
#    exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic,
#    which is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to
#    noise.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
#    corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass and end UT headers
#    are updated to match that of the last-observed frame contributing
#    to the mosaic.
#    -  The photometry tabulation includes the file name, source name,
#    time, filter, airmass, the catalogue magnitude and estimates of
#    the zero-point with and without the application of a mean
#    extinction.  There are headings at the top of each column.
#    -  The photometry uses the mode calculated from 3*median-2*mean
#    and Chauvenet's rejection criterion to estimate the sky level in an
#    annulus about the source.  The inner annulus diameter is 1.3 times
#    that of the aperture (6.5 arcsec); the outer annulus is 2.5 times
#    (12.5 arcsec) for UFTI and twice the aperture (10 arcsec) for IRCAM.
#    The errors are internal, based on the sky noise.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The resultant mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August these
#    were "g" and "rg" respectively.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI and "i" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August
#    IRCAM frames had prefix "ro".

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter, excluding the sky frame.
#       If absent, the number of offsets, as given by header NOFFSETS,
#       minus two is used.  If neither is available, 5 is used.  An
#       error state arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer
#       than 3.  []

SKY_AND_JITTER_APHOT -- Reduces a "combined jitter" photometry observation, and performs aperture photometry.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "combined jitter" photometry observation with
UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising one or
more sets of frames, each set containing a sky frame, followed by
jittered object frames; and a pre-determined flat-field frame to make
a calibrated, trimmed mosaic automatically.

This recipe performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, sky
subtraction, flat-field division, feature detection and matching
between object frames, and resampling.  See the L<"NOTES"> for
details.

Photometry of the point source using a fixed 5-arcsecond aperture
is calculated for each jitter frame and the mosaic.  The results
appear in F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/aphot_results.txt> in the form of a Starlink
small text list.  The analysis of each star is appended to this file.

This recipe is suitable for moderately faint point sources.
