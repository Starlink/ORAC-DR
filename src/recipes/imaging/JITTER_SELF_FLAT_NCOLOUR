# Name:
#    JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a multi-colour "standard jitter" photometry observation
#    using object masking.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation
#    with near-infrared imaging observed through one or more filters.  For
#    each filter it takes an observation comprising jittered object
#    frames and a dark frame to make a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic
#    automatically.

#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field creation and division, feature
#    detection and matching between object frames, and resampling.
#    See the "Notes" for further information.

#    This recipe works well for faint sources and for moderately
#    crowded fields.

# Notes:
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The flat field is created iteratively.  First an approximate
#    flat-field is created by combining normalised object frames using
#    the median at each pixel.  This flat field is applied to the object
#    frames.  Sources within the flat-fielded frames are detected, and
#    masked in the dark-subtracted frames.  The first stage is repeated
#    but applied to the masked frames to create the final flat field.
#    -  Registration is performed using common point sources in the
#    overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
#    objects, the script resorts to using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.
#    -  For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic,
#    which has its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master
#    mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also
#    summed and stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise
#    the end airmass and end UT headers are updated to match that of the
#    last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  Integrated mosaics in <m><date>_<group_number>_<filter>_mos, where
#    <m> is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM and IRIS2.  Before 2000 August these
#    were "g" and "rg" respectively, and <filter> is the filter
#    name.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of jittered frames for each filter in
#    <m><date>_<group_number>_<filter>_mos<cycle_number>, where
#    <cycle_number> counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI and "i" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August
#    IRCAM frames had prefix "ro". IRIS2 data are in <date><obs_number>_ff,
#    where <date> is in the form "ddmmm".
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<filter>_<group_number>
#    for the first or only cycle, and
#    flat_<filter>_<group_number>_c<cycle_number> for subsequent
#    cycles.

#       offsets, as given by header NOFFSETS, minus one is used.  If
#       neither is available, 5 is used.  An error state arises if
#       the number of jittered frames is fewer than 3.  []

JITTER_SELF_FLAT_NCOLOUR -- Reduces a multi-colour "standard jitter" photometry observation using object masking.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation with
UKIRT imaging observed through one or more filters.  For each
filter it takes an UFTI observation comprising jittered object frames
and a dark frame to make a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
subtraction, flat-field creation and division, feature
detection and matching between object frames, and resampling.
See the L<"NOTES"> for further information.

This recipe works well for faint sources and for moderately
crowded fields.
