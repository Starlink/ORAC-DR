=head1 NAME

EXTENDED_5x5 -- Basic Extended-source standard reduction using
interpolated sky subtraction.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces an extended source using IRIS2 imaging data.
The data comprise alternating blank-sky and target frames commencing
and ending with a blank sky.  The target frames are arranged in an
overlapping (30-50%) grid of 5x5 frames from which the recipe
makes a sky-subtracted untrimmed mosaic automatically.

The script performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
subtraction, flat-field division, sky subtraction, registration using
telescope offsets, and mosaicking.  The L<"NOTES"> give more details.

It is suitable for extended objects up to 20 arcminutes across
IRIS2.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
created in the headers should no WCS already exist.

=item *

The bad-pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item *

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

=item *

The flat field is derived from the sky frames as follows.  The
mode (sigma-clipped mean) is used to offset each sky frame's mode
to that of the first sky frame.  The corrected sky frames are
combined pixel by pixel using a median of the values in each
frame.  The resultant frame is normalised by its median to form
the flat field.  This frame median is subtracted from the source
frames after they have been flat-fielded.  A flat field is created
for each row of the grid of target frames, and applied only to
that row of target frames.

=item *

The sky subtraction comes from linear interpolation of the sky
modal values of the two sky frames which immediately bracket the
target frame.

=item *

Registration is performed using the telescope offsets transformed to
pixels.

=item *

There is no resampling, merely integer shifts of origin.

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The noise will be greater in the mosaic's peripheral areas, having
received less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its
exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

Mosaics are made and displayed for each row, except the last. At the
end of each cycle of 19 frames the full mosaic of nine target frames
is created and displayed instead.  On the second and subsequent cycles
the full mosaic is added into a master mosaic of improving signal to
noise.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass and end UT
headers are updated to match that of the last-observed frame
contributing to the mosaic.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The resultant mosaic in
E<lt>mE<gt>E<lt>dateE<gt>_E<lt>group_numberE<gt>_mos, where
E<lt>mE<gt> is "gi" for IRIS2.

=item *

A mosaic for each row in
E<lt>mE<gt>E<lt>dateE<gt>_E<lt>group_numberE<gt>_mosE<lt>row_numberE<gt>,
where E<lt>row_numberE<gt> is 0 or 1.

=item *

The individual flat-fielded frames in
E<lt>dateE<gt>E<lt>obs_numberE<gt>_ff, where E<lt>dateE<gt>
is of the form DDMMM.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURABLE STEERING PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item NROW = INTEGER

The number of target frames in a row of the mosaic.  Its
minimum is 3 because this number of blank skies are needed to
form a flat field. [5]

=item NCOL = INTEGER

The number of target frames in a column of the mosaic.  Its
minimum is 2. [5]

=item USEVAR = LOGICAL

Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]

=back

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

=over 4

=item *

The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK,
KAPPA, and FIGARO.

=item *

Uses the Starlink NDF format.

=item *

History is recorded within the data files.

=item *

The title of the data is propagated through intermediate files
to the mosaic.

=item *

Error propagation is controlled by the USEVAR parameter.
