# CHOP_SKY_JITTER_NODIST

# Name:
#    CHOP_SKY_JITTER_NODIST

# Purpose:
#    Reduction of alternating sky-target jitters using interpolated sky
#    subtraction, but no astrometric distortion correction.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe reduces a moderately extended source using near-infrared
#    imaging data.  The data comprise alternating blank-sky and target
#    frames commencing and ending with a blank sky.  Both the sky and target
#    frames are jittered.  The recipe makes a sky-subtracted untrimmed
#    mosaic automatically.

#    The script performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field division, sky subtraction, registration,
#    resampling, and mosaicking.  The "Notes" give more details.

#    It is suitable for extended objects where the object fills or nearly
#    fills the frame, so sky estimation within the frame is impossible or
#    unreliable, but the extended mapping of the target is not required.

# Notes:
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    headers are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  For INGRID, the pre- and post-exposure images are subtracted.
#    A non-linearity correction is then applied.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The flat field is derived from the sky frames as follows.  The
#    mode (sigma-clipped mean) is used to offset each sky frame's mode
#    to that of the first sky frame.  The corrected sky frames are
#    combined pixel by pixel using a median of the values in each
#    frame.  The resultant frame is normalised by its median to form
#    the flat field.  This frame median is subtracted from the source
#    frames after they have been flat-fielded.  A flat field is created
#    from all the jittered sky frames, and applied to all the target
#    frames.
#    -  For ISAAC, residual bias variations along the columns are
#    largely removed from each flat-fielded frame.  The recipe first
#    masks the sources, then collapses the frame along its rows to form
#    a profile, whose clipped mean is subtracted.  The resultant profile
#    reflects the bias variations.  The recipe subtracts this profile
#    from each column of the flat-fielded frame.
#    -  The sky subtraction comes from linear interpolation of the sky
#    modal values of the two flat-fielded sky frames which immediately
#    bracket the target frame.
#    -  The field distortion of ISAAC is corrected in the target frames
#    using the mappings documented on the ISAAC problems web page.
#    -  Registration is performed using common point sources in the
#    overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
#    objects, it then tries the crosshead offsets.  If these are null,
#    the script resorts to the telescope offsets.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The noise will be greater in the mosaic's peripheral areas, having
#    received less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its
#    exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  At the end of each cycle of sky and object frames the full
#    mosaic of target frames is created and displayed.  The mosaic has
#    its bad pixels filled by interpolation.  On the second and
#    subsequent cycles the full mosaic is added into a master mosaic of
#    improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
#    stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise the end
#    airmass and end UT headers are updated to match that of the
#    last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM (before 2000 August these were
#    "g" and "rg" respectively), "gi" also for IRIS2, "gu" for UIST,
#    "gisaac" for ISAAC, and "gingrid" for INGRID.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of jittered frames in
#    <m><date>_<group_number>_mos<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI, "i" for IRCAM (before 2000 August IRCAM
#    frames had prefix "ro"), "u" for UIST, and "isaac" for ISAAC.
#    IRIS2 data are named <date><obs_number>_ff, where <date> is in the
#    form "ddmmm".   INGRID files are called r<obs_number>_ff.

#    <i><date>_<obs_number>_bc.
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<filter>_<group_number> for the

CHOP_SKY_JITTER -- Reduction of alternating sky-target jitters using interpolated sky subtraction.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces a moderately extended source using near-infrared imaging
data.  The data comprise alternating blank-sky and target frames
commencing and ending with a blank sky.  Both the sky and target
frames are jittered.  The recipe makes a sky-subtracted untrimmed
mosaic automatically.

The script performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
subtraction, flat-field division, sky subtraction, registration,
resampling, and mosaicking.  The L<"NOTES"> give more details.

It is suitable for extended objects where the object fills or nearly
fills the frame, so sky estimation within the frame is impossible or
unreliable, but the extended mapping of the target is not required.

=item *

A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
created in the headers should no WCS already exist.

=item *

For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
headers are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.

=item *

The bad pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item *

For INGRID, the pre- and post-exposure images are subtracted.
A non-linearity correction is then applied.

=item *

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

=item *

The flat field is derived from the sky frames as follows.  The
mode (sigma-clipped mean) is used to offset each sky frame's mode
to that of the first sky frame.  The corrected sky frames are
combined pixel by pixel using a median of the values in each
frame.  The resultant frame is normalised by its median to form
the flat field.  This frame median is subtracted from the source
frames after they have been flat-fielded.  A flat field is created
from all the jittered sky frames, and applied to all the target
frames.

=item *

For ISAAC, residual bias variations along the columns are
largely removed from each flat-fielded frame.  The recipe first
masks the sources, then collapses the frame along its rows to form
a profile, whose clipped mean is subtracted.  The resultant profile
reflects the bias variations.  The recipe subtracts this profile
from each column of the flat-fielded frame.

=item *

The sky subtraction comes from linear interpolation of the sky modal
values of the two flat-fielded sky frames which immediately bracket
the target frame.

=item *

The field distortion of ISAAC is corrected in the target frames using
the mappings documented on the ISAAC problems web page.

=item *

Registration is performed using common point sources in the
overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
objects, it matches the centroid of the central source.  If this
fails, the script resorts to using the telescope offsets
transformed to pixels.

=item *

The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The noise will be greater in the mosaic's peripheral areas, having
received less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its
exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

At the end of each cycle of sky and object frames the full mosaic of
target frames is created and displayed.  The mosaic has its bad pixels
filled by interpolation.  On the second and subsequent cycles the full
mosaic is added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise. The
exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's corresponding
header.  Likewise the end airmass and end UT headers are updated to
match that of the last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
