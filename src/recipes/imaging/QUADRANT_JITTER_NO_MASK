# Name:
#    QUADRANT_JITTER_NO_MASK

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a "Quadrant Jitter" observation without object masking.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "quadrant jitter" photometry observation
#    with near-infrared imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
#    one or more series of four object frames where the target is
#    approximately centred in each quadrant; and a dark frame to make
#    a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

#    It performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark subtraction,
#    flat-field creation and division, feature detection and matching
#    between object frames, and resampling.   See the "Notes" for
#    further information.

#    This recipe is suitable for faint objects or objects within
#    a comparatively bright core embedded in faint extended emission,
#    e.g. a quasar; or extended objects less than 45 arcseconds across
#    with UFTI, 10 arcseconds with IRCAM, and 2 arcminutes with IRIS2.
#    If there are other objects
#    of comparable brightness to the principal target in other quadrants,
#    they will introduce artifacts into the flat field.  Use
#    QUADRANT_JITTER for those.

# Notes:
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The flat field is created in two steps.  The quadrant
#    containing the object is masked in each object frame.  Then the
#    recipe combines the normalised and quadrant-masked object frames
#    using the median at each pixel.
#    -  Registration is performed using common point sources in the
#    overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
#    objects, it matches the centroid of the central source.  If this
#    fails, the script resorts to using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame.  Thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The full signal will be in the central ninth
#    containing the main object.  The mosaic is not normalised by its
#    exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of four, the recipe creates a mosaic, which has
#    its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master mosaic of
#    improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
#    stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise the end
#    airmass and end UT headers are updated to match that of the
#    last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM and IRIS2.  Before 2000 August these
#    were "g" and "rg" respectively.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of four in
#    <m><date>_<group_number>_mos<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI and "i" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August

QUADRANT_JITTER_NO_MASK -- Reduces a "Quadrant Jitter" observation without object masking.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "quadrant jitter" photometry observation with
UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising one or
more series of four object frames where the target is approximately
centred in each quadrant; and a dark frame to make a calibrated,
untrimmed mosaic automatically.

It performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark subtraction,
flat-field creation and division, feature detection and matching
between object frames, and resampling.   See the L<"NOTES"> for
further information.

This recipe is suitable for faint objects or objects within a
comparatively bright core embedded in faint extended emission, e.g. a
quasar; or extended objects less than 45 arcseconds across with UFTI
and 10 arcseconds with IRCAM.  If there are other objects of
comparable brightness to the principal target in other quadrants, they
will introduce artifacts into the flat field.  Use
L<QUADRANT_JITTER|QUADRANT_JITTER> for those.
