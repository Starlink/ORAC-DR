# Name:
#    SKY_FLAT

# Purpose:
#    Creates and files a flat field derived from dithered frames.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe makes a sky flat for LCOGT imaging from a series of sky
#    or Lambert flat frames which are combined using one of a selection of
#    statistics.  It expects a series of dithered sky frames in different 
#    filters.
#
#    It performs debiassing, bad-pixel masking, and dark subtraction
#    before combining normalised frames pixel by pixel using the median.
#    Details of the flat are filed in the index of flats for future
#    selection and use of the flat.  See the "Notes" for further details.
#
#    For best results the field observed should contain few stars and no
#    bright ones.  Ideally the telescope should have been pointed to the "flat
#    spot" - usually 5 to 10 degrees away from the zenith in the anti-solar 
#    direction to minimize gradients in the resultant flat.
#
# Notes:
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is the binning-appropriate match taken from the
#    $ORAC_DATA_CAL/index.mask calibration index.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.

# Output Data:
#    - The created flat fields are of the form flat_<instrument>_<UT
#    night>_<flattype>_bin<Xbin>x<Ybin>_<filter>>[_c<cycle_number>]
#    where <instrument> is the LCOGT instrument identifier, <flattype> is the 
#    type of flat (either 'SKYFLAT' or 'FAKEFLAT' (a unity flat)), <filter> is
#    the common name of the filter (e.g. 'R') and <Xbin>, <Ybin> are the 
#    binning factors in X and Y.  If a flat of the same name already exists, 
#    a <cycle_number> will be added, counting from one.
#    -  The flats are filed in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.flat.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:

#       The number of frames in the jitter.  If absent, the number of
#       offsets, as given by header NOFFSETS, minus one is used.  If
#       neither is available, 5 is used.  An error state arises if
#       the number of dithered frames is fewer than 3.  []

SKY_FLAT -- Creates and files a flat field derived from dithered frames.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe makes a sky flat for LCOGT imaging from a series of sky
or Lambert flat frames which are combined using one of a selection of
statistics.  It expects a series of dithered sky frames in different filters.

It performs debiassing, bad-pixel masking, and dark subtraction
before combining normalised frames pixel by pixel using the median.
Details of the flat are filed in the index of flats for future
selection and use of the flat.  See the L<"NOTES"> for further details.

For best results the field observed should contain few stars and no
bright ones.  Ideally the telescope should have been pointed to the "flat
spot" - usually 5 to 10 degrees away from the zenith in the anti-solar direction
to minimize gradients in the resultant flat.
