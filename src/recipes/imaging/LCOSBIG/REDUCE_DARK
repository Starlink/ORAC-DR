# Name:
#    REDUCE_DARK

# Purpose:
#    Averages and files observations as the current dark.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe reduces dark-frame observations from optical imaging
#    data.  Individual darks are scaled by the exposure time before being averaged.
#    It files the averaged dark in the dark index file after checking whether 
#    it's mean is within the allowed tolerance.  Other reduction steps comprise 
#    bad-pixel masking, optional creation of data errors.

# Notes:
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.

# Output Data:
#    -  The masterdark.  It is called
#    "dark_<instrument>_<UT night>_bin<Xbin>x<Ybin>" where <instrument> is the
#    LCOGT instrument identifier and <Xbin>,<Ybin> are the binning factors
#    in X and Y.
#    -  The dark is filed in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.dark.
#    -  If $FINAL_DATA_OUT is set, the masterdark is converted to FITS and
#    copied there and a PNG version is moved to $FINAL_DATA_OUT.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages KAPPA and CCDPACK.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through the intermediate file
#    to the dark.

REDUCE_DARK -- Averages and files observations as the current dark.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces dark-frame observations from optical imaging
data.  Individual darks are scaled by the exposure time before being averaged.
It files the averaged dark in the dark index file after checking whether it's
mean is within the allowed tolerance.  Other reduction steps comprise bad-pixel 
masking, optional creation of data errors.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

The bad-pixel mask applied is the binning-appropriate match taken from the
F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/index.mask> calibration index.


=item *

Intermediate frames are deleted.

=head1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

The dark is called dark_E<lt>instrumentE<gt>_E<lt>UT nightE<gt>_binE<lt>XbinE<gt>xE<lt>YbinE<gt> 
where E<lt>instrumentE<gt> is the LCOGT instrument identifier and E<lt>XbinE<gt>,
E<lt>YbinE<gt> are the binning factors in X and Y.

=item *

The dark is filed in F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.dark> after checking whether it's
mean is within the allowed tolerance.

=item *

If F<$FINAL_DATA_OUT> is set, the masterdark is converted to FITS and copied
there and a PNG version of the masterdark is created and moved to F<$FINAL_DATA_OUT>.
