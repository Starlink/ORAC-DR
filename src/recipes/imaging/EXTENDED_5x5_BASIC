# Name:
#    EXTENDED_5x5_BASIC

# Purpose:
#    Basic extended-source standard reduction using interpolated sky
#    subtraction.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe reduces an extended source using near-infrared imaging data.
#    The data comprise alternating blank-sky and target frames commencing
#    and ending with a blank sky.  The target frames are arranged in an
#    overlapping (30-50%) grid of 5x5 frames from which the recipe
#    makes a sky-subtracted untrimmed mosaic automatically.

#    The script performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field division, sky subtraction, registration
#    using telescope offsets, and mosaicking.  The "Notes" give more
#    details.

#    It is suitable for extended objects up to 3 arcminutes across
#    with UFTI, 42 arcseconds with IRCAM, and 20 arcminutes with IRIS2.

# Notes:
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    headers are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The flat field is derived from the sky frames as follows.  The
#    mode (sigma-clipped mean) is used to offset each sky frame's mode
#    to that of the first sky frame.  The corrected sky frames are
#    combined pixel by pixel using a median of the values in each
#    frame.  The resultant frame is normalised by its median to form
#    the flat field.  This frame median is subtracted from the source
#    frames after they have been flat-fielded.  A flat field is created
#    for each row of the grid of target frames, and applied only to
#    that row of target frames.
#    -  The sky subtraction comes from linear interpolation of the sky
#    modal values of the two flat-fielded sky frames which immediately
#    bracket the target frame.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  There is no resampling, merely integer shifts of origin.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The noise will be greater in the mosaic's peripheral areas, having
#    received less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its
#    exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  Mosaics are made and displayed for each row, except the last.
#    At the end of each cycle of 51 frames the full mosaic of 25 target
#    frames is created and displayed instead.  On the second and
#    subsequent cycles the full mosaic is added into a master mosaic of
#    improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
#    stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise the end
#    airmass and end UT headers are updated to match that of the
#    last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The full mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM (before 2000 August these were
#    "g" and "rg" respectively), "gi" also for IRIS2, and "gu" for UIST.
#    -  A mosaic for each row in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos<row_number>,
#    where <row_number> is 0 to 3.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI, "i" for IRCAM (before 2000 August IRCAM
#    frames had prefix "ro"), "u" for UIST.  IRIS2 data are named
#    <date><obs_number>_ff, where <date> is in the form "ddmmm".

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NROW = INTEGER
#       The number of target frames in a row of the mosaic.  Its
#       minimum is 3 because this number of blank skies are needed to
#       form a flat field. [5]
#    NCOL = INTEGER
#       The number of target frames in a column of the mosaic.  Its
#       minimum is 2. [5]

=head1 NAME

EXTENDED_5x5_BASIC -- Basic extended-source standard reduction using interpolated sky subtraction.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces an extended source using UKIRT imaging data.  The
data comprise alternating blank-sky and target frames commencing and
ending with a blank sky.  The target frames are arranged in an
overlapping (30-50%) grid of 5x5 frames from which the recipe makes a
sky-subtracted untrimmed mosaic automatically.

The script performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark
subtraction, flat-field division, sky subtraction, registration
using telescope offsets, and mosaicking.  The L<"NOTES"> give more
details.

It is suitable for extended objects up to 3 arcminutes across
with UFTI and 42 arcseconds with IRCAM.

=item *

A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
created in the headers should no WCS already exist.

=item *

For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
headers are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.

=item *

The bad-pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item *

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

=item *

The flat field is derived from the sky frames as follows.  The
mode (sigma-clipped mean) is used to offset each sky frame's mode
to that of the first sky frame.  The corrected sky frames are
combined pixel by pixel using a median of the values in each
frame.  The resultant frame is normalised by its median to form
the flat field.  This frame median is subtracted from the source
frames after they have been flat-fielded.  A flat field is created
for each row of the grid of target frames, and applied only to
that row of target frames.

=item *

The sky subtraction comes from linear interpolation of the sky
modal values of the two flat-fielded sky frames which immediately
bracket the target frame.

=item *

Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
transformed to pixels.

=item *

The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The noise will be greater in the mosaic's peripheral areas, having
received less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its
exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

Mosaics are made and displayed for each row, except the last. At the
end of each cycle of 51 frames the full mosaic of 25 target frames is
created and displayed instead.  On the second and subsequent cycles
the full mosaic is added into a master mosaic of improving signal to
noise.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass and end UT
headers are updated to match that of the last-observed frame
contributing to the mosaic.

Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
suffix) frames.
