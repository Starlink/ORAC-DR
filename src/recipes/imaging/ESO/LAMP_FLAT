# Name:
#    LAMP_FLAT

# Purpose:
#    Creates and files imaging flat fields derived from a calibration lamp.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe makes one or more flats for ESO infrared imaging from
#    a series of internal flat frames with the calibration lamp
#    alternating on then off.  A new flat is made for each combination
#    of filter.
#
#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, then differences
#    each pair of frames.  Once all pairs have been so processed,
#    these are then treated like sky flats; normalised frames are
#    combined pixel by pixel using the median.  Details of each flat are
#    filed in the index of flats for future selection and use of the flat.
#    See the "Notes" for further details.
#
# Notes:
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<filter>_<group_number> for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<filter>_<group_number>_c<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent recipe cycles.  Token <filter> is the filter name,
#    <group_number> is the frame number of the group, and <cycle_number>
#    is the number of the cycle, counting from one.
#    -  The flats are filed in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.flat.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the group.  If absent, the number of
#       offsets, as given by header HIERARCH.ESO.TPL.NEXP.  If neither
#       is available, 6 is used.  An error state arises if the number of
#       jittered frames is fewer than 6 or is odd numbered.  []

LAMP_FLAT -- Creates and files imaging flat fields derived from a calibration lamp.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe makes one or more flats for ESO infrared imaging from
a series of internal flat frames with the calibration lamp
alternating on then off.  A new flat is made for each combination
of filter.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, then differences
each pair of frames.  Once all pairs have been so processed,
these are then treated like sky flats; normalised frames are
combined pixel by pixel using the median.  Details of each flat are
filed in the index of flats for future selection and use of the flat.
See the L<"NOTES"> for further details.

=item *

The bad-pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item *

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

Intermediate frames are deleted.

Sub-arrays are supported.

=item *

The created flat fields in flat_E<lt>filterE<gt>_E<lt>group_numberE<gt> for the
first or only cycle, and flat_E<lt>filterE<gt>_E<lt>group_numberE<gt>_cE<lt>cycle_numberE<gt>
for subsequent recipe cycles.  Token E<lt>filterE<gt> is the filter name,
E<lt>group_numberE<gt> is the frame number of the group, and E<lt>cycle_numberE<gt>
is the number of the cycle, counting from one.

The flats are filed in F<$ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.flat>.
