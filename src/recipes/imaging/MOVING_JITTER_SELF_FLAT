# Name:
#    MOVING_JITTER_SELF_FLAT

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation of a
#    moving target using object masking.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation
#    with UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an observation comprising
#    jittered object frames of a moving target and a dark frame to
#    make automatically a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic in the reference
#    frame of the target.

#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field creation and division, feature
#    detection and matching between object frames, and resampling.
#    See the "Notes" for further information.

#    Registration is adjusted to track the motion of the moving
#    target using ephemeris data stored in file target_ephem.dat.
#    See "Ephemeris-file Format" for details of this file's format.

#    This recipe works well for faint moving sources and in moderately
#    crowded fields.  It should not be used for frames where the
#    telescope guided on the moving object.  In that case reduction
#    should be performed by JITTER_SELF_FLAT_TELE which registers
#    using the telescope offsets alone.

# Notes:
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The flat field is created iteratively.  First an approximate
#    flat-field is created by combining normalised object frames using
#    the median at each pixel.  This flat field is applied to the object
#    frames.  Sources within the flat-fielded frames are detected, and
#    masked in the dark-subtracted frames.  The first stage is repeated
#    but applied to the masked frames to create the final flat field.
#    -  Registration is performed using common point sources in the
#    overlap regions.  If the recipe cannot identify sufficient common
#    objects, the script resorts to using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.  Once the offsets are determined, they
#    are adjusted for the motion of the target, so that the final
#    mosaic registers the target, not the background stars.
#    -  The ephemeris file is specified by environment variable
#    ORAC_EPHEMERIS, defaulting to $ORAC_DATA_OUT/target_ephem.dat.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic,
#    which has its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master
#    mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also
#    summed and stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise
#    the end airmass and end UT headers are updated to match that of the
#    last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Ephemeris-file Format:
#    The current format of the ephemeris file is one line per object
#    comprising three space-separated fields in the following order:
#      - the objectname, which may contain embedded spaces;
#      - the motion in the plane of the sky in arcsec/second for right
#      ascension then declination.
#
#    Note that the right ascension motion is the change in right ascension
#    multiplied by the cosine of the declination.  The format will change
#    to include UT and possibly date.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August these
#    were "g" and "rg" respectively.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of jittered frames in
#    <m><date>_<group_number>_mos<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI and "i" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August
#    IRCAM frames had prefix "ro".
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<filter>_<group_number> for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<filter>_<group_number>_c<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent cycles.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:

#       The number of frames in the jitter pattern.  If not supplied
#       the number of offsets, as given by FITS header NOFFSETS, minus
#       one is used.  If neither is available, 9 is the default.  An
#       error state arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer
#       than 3.  For observations prior to the availability of full
#       ORAC, header NOFFSETS will be absent.  []

MOVING_JITTER_SELF_FLAT -- Reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation of a moving target using object masking.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation with
with UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an observation comprising
jittered object frames of a moving target and a dark frame to
make automatically a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic in the reference
frame of the target.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
subtraction, flat-field creation and division, feature
detection and matching between object frames, and resampling.
See the L<"NOTES"> for further information.

Registration is adjusted to track the motion of the moving
target using ephemeris data stored in file target_ephem.dat.
See L<"EPHEMERIS-FILE FORMAT"> for details of this file's format.

This recipe works well for faint moving sources and in moderately
crowded fields.  It should not be used for frames where the telescope
guided on the moving object.  In that case reduction should be
performed by L<JITTER_SELF_FLAT_TELE|JITTER_SELF_FLAT_TELE> which
registers using the telescope offsets alone.

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity

the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received

For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic, which
has its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master mosaic of
improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also summed and
stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass
and end UT headers are updated to match that of the last-observed
frame contributing to the mosaic.
