# Name:
#    NOD_CHOP_SCAN

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a chopped and nodded observation in a scan pattern.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces chopped and nodded observation, currently
#    just for Michelle data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
#    a multiple-of-four object frames at a series of scan offset
#    positions to make calibrated, untrimmed mosaics at each scan
#    position automatically.

#    It performs a null debiassing, creation and propagation of data
#    variance, difference the integrations for each AB chop beam pair,
#    bad-pixel masking, difference adjacent nodded pairs, registers the
#    frames, and forms a mosaic at each scan position.  Column and row
#    patterns are filtered.  See the "Notes" for further information.

# Notes:
#    -  A variance array is created for each beam, first using the read
#    noise, and once the bias is removed, Poisson noise is added.
#    -  A bias frame selected from the calibration system is removed from
#    each beam in CHOP read mode.  If no bias frame is available
#    in the CHOP mode, the recipe subtracts a null bias, so the errors
#    will be overestimated in the CHOP read mode; the data array will
#    be unaffected once the beams are differenced.  The ARRAY_TESTS
#    recipe files a suitable short-exposure dark as a bias in the
#    calibration system.
#    -  The integrations of the two beams are differenced, the first
#    subtracted from the second in each pair.
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  The telescope offsets of the first frame in each multiple-of-four
#    frames define scan position.  The recipe creates a mosaic at each
#    distinct pair of offsets.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies integer shifts of origin.   There is no
#    rotation to align the Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of object frames at each distinct scan position,
#    the recipe creates a mosaic, which has its bad pixels filled and is
#    then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise for
#    that scan position.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in
#    the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass and end
#    UT headers are updated to match that of the last-observed frame
#    contributing to the mosaic.
#    -   Pickup and bias variation patterns, evident as ripples in the
#    rows or bands in the columns respectively, are removed by
#    subtracting the median along each column or row from the pixels
#    in that column or row.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the differenced pairs
#    (_dp suffix), and the bias and pickup corrected frames (_cpc and
#    _rpc suffices).

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaics in <m><date>_<group_number>_o<scan>_mos,
#    where <m> is "gm" for Michelle, <group_number> is the number of
#    group, and <scan> is the index number of the distinct scan
#    position counting from 0.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of object frames in
#    <m><date>_<group_number>_o<scan>_mos<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.

#       The number of frames in the nod pattern.  If absent, the number
#       of offsets, as given by header NOFFSETS, minus one is used.  If

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces chopped and nodded observation, currently
just for Michelle data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
a multiple-of-four object frames at a series of scan offset
positions to make calibrated, untrimmed mosaics at each scan
position automatically.

It performs a null debiassing, creation and propagation of data
variance, difference the integrations for each AB chop beam pair,
bad-pixel masking, difference adjacent nodded pairs, registers the
frames, and forms a mosaic at each scan position.  Column and row
patterns are filtered.  See the L<"NOTES"> for further information.

=item *

A variance array is created for each beam, first using the read
noise, and once the bias is removed, Poisson noise is added.

=item *

A bias frame selected from the calibration system is removed from each
beam in CHOP read mode.  If no bias frame is available in the CHOP
mode, the recipe subtracts a null bias, so the errors will be
overestimated in the CHOP read mode; the data array will be unaffected
once the beams are differenced.  The L<ARRAY_TESTS|ARRAY_TESTS> recipe
files a suitable short-exposure dark as a bias in the calibration
system.

=item *

The integrations of the two beams are differenced, the first
subtracted from the second in each pair.

=item *

A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
created in the headers should no WCS already exist.

=item *

The bad pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item *

The telescope offsets of the first frame in each multiple-of-four
frames define scan position.  The recipe creates a mosaic at each
distinct pair of offsets.

=item *

Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
transformed to pixels.

=item *

The resampling applies integer shifts of origin.   There is no
rotation to align the Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

For each cycle of object frames at each distinct scan position,
the recipe creates a mosaic, which has its bad pixels filled and is
then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise for
that scan position.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in
the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass and end
UT headers are updated to match that of the last-observed frame
contributing to the mosaic.

Pickup and bias variation patterns, evident as ripples in the rows
or bands in the columns respectively, are removed by subtracting
the median along each column or row from the pixels in that
column or row.
