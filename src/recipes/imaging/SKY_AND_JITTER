# Name:
#    SKY_AND_JITTER

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a "combined jitter" photometry observation.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "combined jitter" photometry observation
#    with UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation
#    comprising one or more sets of frames, each set containing a sky
#    frame, followed by jittered object frames; and a pre-determined
#    flat-field frame to make a calibrated, trimmed mosaic automatically.

#    This recipe performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, sky
#    subtraction, flat-field division, feature detection and matching
#    between object frames, and resampling.  See the "Notes" for details.

#    This recipe is suitable for moderately faint point sources.

# Notes:
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  You may use SKY_FLAT or SKY_FLAT_MASKED to make the flat field.
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The most-recent sky frame is used for the sky subtraction.
#    -  Where automatic registration is not possible, the recipe matches
#    the centroid of central source, and should that fail, it resorts
#    to using the telescope offsets transformed to pixels.
#    -  The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
#    bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
#    Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaic by applying offsets in intensity to
#    give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is trimmed to the dimensions of an input frame.  The
#    mosaic is not normalised by its exposure time (that being the
#    exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic,
#    which is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to
#    noise.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
#    corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass and end UT headers
#    are updated to match that of the last-observed frame contributing
#    to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The resultant mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August these
#    were "g" and "rg" respectively.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI and "i" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August
#    IRCAM frames had prefix "ro".

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter, excluding the sky frame.
#       If absent, the number of offsets, as given by header NOFFSETS,
#       minus two is used.  If neither is available, 5 is used.  An
#       error state arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer
#       than 3.  []
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK,
#    KAPPA, and FIGARO.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through intermediate files
#    to the mosaic.
#    -  Error propagation is controlled by the USEVAR parameter.

SKY_AND_JITTER -- Reduces a "combined jitter" photometry observation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "combined jitter" photometry observation with
UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising one or
more sets of frames, each set containing a sky frame, followed by
jittered object frames; and a pre-determined flat-field frame to make
a calibrated, trimmed mosaic automatically.

This recipe performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, sky
subtraction, flat-field division, feature detection and matching
between object frames, and resampling.  See the L<"NOTES"> for details.

This recipe is suitable for moderately faint point sources.

=item *

A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
created in the headers should no WCS already exist.

=item *

For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.

=item *

You may use L<SKY_FLAT|SKY_FLAT> or L<SKY_FLAT_MASKED|SKY_FLAT_MASKED>
to make the flat field.

=item *

The bad-pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item *

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

=item *

The most-recent sky frame is used for the sky subtraction.

=item *

Where automatic registration is not possible, the recipe matches
the centroid of central source, and should that fail, it resorts
to using the telescope offsets transformed to pixels.

=item *

The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaic by applying offsets in intensity to
give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The mosaic is trimmed to the dimensions of an input frame.  The
mosaic is not normalised by its exposure time (that being the
exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic, which
is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise. The
exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's corresponding
header.  Likewise the end airmass and end UT headers are updated to
match that of the last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.

Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
suffix) frames.
