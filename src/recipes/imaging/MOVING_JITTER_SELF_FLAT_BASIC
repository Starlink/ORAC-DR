# Name:
#    MOVING_JITTER_SELF_FLAT_BASIC

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation of a
#    moving target using just the basic operations for speed.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation
#    with UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an observation comprising
#    jittered object frames of a moving target and a dark frame to
#    make automatically a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic in the reference
#    frame of the target.

#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
#    subtraction, flat-field creation and division, amd integer shifts
#    of pixel origin to register to fixed sky co-ordinates.   See the
#    "Notes" for further information.

#    The registration is adjusted to track the motion of the moving
#    target using ephemeris data stored in file target_ephem.dat.
#    See "Ephemeris-file Format" for details of this file's format.

#    This recipe aims to keep pace with the pipeline's incoming data.
#    It works well for faint moving sources and in moderately
#    crowded fields.  It should not be used for frames where the
#    telescope guided on the moving object.  In that case reduction
#    should be performed by JITTER_SELF_FLAT_TELE which registers
#    using the telescope offsets alone.

# Notes:
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The flat field is created by combining normalised object
#    frames using the median at each pixel.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.  Once the offsets are determined, they
#    are adjusted for the motion of the target, so that the final
#    mosaic registers the target, not the background stars.
#    -  There is no resampling, merely integer shifts of origin.
#    -  The ephemeris file is specified by environment variable
#    ORAC_EPHEMERIS, defaulting to $ORAC_DATA_OUT/target_ephem.dat.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic,
#    which is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to
#    noise.  The exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
#    corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass and end UT headers
#    are updated to match that of the last-observed frame contributing
#    to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Ephemeris-file Format:
#    The current format of the ephemeris file is one line per object
#    comprising three space-separated fields in the following order:
#      - the objectname, which may contain embedded spaces; and
#      - the motion in the plane of the sky in arcsec/second for right
#    ascension then declination.
#
#    Note that the right-ascension motion is the change in right ascension
#    multiplied by the cosine of the declination.  The format may change
#    to include UT and possibly date.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August these
#    were "g" and "rg" respectively.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of jittered frames in
#    <m><date>_<group_number>_mos<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI and "i" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August
#    IRCAM frames had prefix "ro".
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<filter>_<group_number> for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<filter>_<group_number>_c<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent cycles.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter pattern.  If not supplied
#       the number of offsets, as given by FITS header NOFFSETS, minus
#       one is used.  If neither is available, 9 is the default.  An
#       error state arises if the number of jittered frames is fewer
#       than 3.  For observations prior to the availability of full
#       ORAC, header NOFFSETS will be absent.  []

MOVING_JITTER_SELF_FLAT_BASIC -- Reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation of a moving target using just the basic operations for speed.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "standard jitter" photometry observation
with UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an observation comprising
jittered object frames of a moving target and a dark frame to
make automatically a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic in the reference
frame of the target.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, dark
subtraction, flat-field creation and division, amd integer shifts
of pixel origin to register to fixed sky co-ordinates.
See the L<"NOTES"> for further information.

The registration is adjusted to track the motion of the moving target
using ephemeris data stored in file F<target_ephem.dat>. See
L<"EPHEMERIS-FILE FORMAT"> for details of this file's format.

This recipe aims to keep pace with the pipeline's incoming data. It
works well for faint moving sources and in moderately crowded fields.
It should not be used for frames where the telescope guided on the
moving object.  In that case reduction should be performed by
L<JITTER_SELF_FLAT_TELE|JITTER_SELF_FLAT_TELE> which registers using
the telescope offsets alone.
