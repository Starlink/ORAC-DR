# Name:
#    QUADRANT_JITTER_BASIC

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a "Quadrant Jitter" observation, using just the basic
#    operations for speed.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a "quadrant jitter" photometry observation
#    with near-infrared imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
#    one or more series of four object frames where the target is
#    approximately centred in each quadrant; and a dark frame to make
#    a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic automatically.

#    It performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark subtraction,
#    flat-field creation and division, and registration using telescope
#    offsets.  See the "Notes" for further information.

#    This recipe aims to keep pace with the pipeline's incoming
#    data and many options which improve the final mosaic are omitted.
#    This recipe is suitable for faint objects or objects within
#    a comparatively bright core embedded in faint extended emission,
#    e.g. a quasar; or extended objects less than 45 arcseconds across
#    with UFTI, 10 arcseconds with IRCAM, and 2 arcminutes with IRIS2.
#    If the object is not
#    isolated, there will be artifacts introduced into the flat field.
#    These arise from the contribution of sources outside the quadrant
#    containing the primary object.  This variant of QUADRANT_JITTER is
#    best for isolated objects or where speed is critical.  Use
#    QUADRANT_JITTER itself if object masking is required instead.

# Notes:
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The flat field is created in two steps.  The quadrant
#    containing the object is masked in each object frame.  Then the
#    recipe combines the normalised and quadrant-masked object frames
#    using the median at each pixel.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixels.
#    -  There is no resampling, merely integer shifts of origin.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame.  Thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The full signal will be in the central ninth
#    containing the main object.  The mosaic is not normalised by its
#    exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of four, the recipe creates a mosaic, which is
#    added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The
#    exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's
#    corresponding header.  Likewise the end airmass and end UT headers
#    are updated to match that of the last-observed frame contributing
#    to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
#    suffix) frames.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gf" for UFTI and "gi" for IRCAM and IRIS2.  Before 2000 August these
#    were "g" and "rg" respectively.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of four in
#    <m><date>_<group_number>_mos<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The individual flat-fielded frames in <i><date>_<obs_number>_ff,
#    where <i> is "f" for UFTI and "i" for IRCAM.  Before 2000 August
#    IRCAM frames had prefix "ro". IRIS2 data are in <date><obs_number>_ff,
#    where <date> is in the form "ddmmm".
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<filter>_<group_number> for the

QUADRANT_JITTER_BASIC -- Reduces a "Quadrant Jitter" observation, using just the basic operations for speed.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a "quadrant jitter" photometry observation with
UKIRT imaging data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising one or
more series of four object frames where the target is approximately
centred in each quadrant; and a dark frame to make a calibrated,
untrimmed mosaic automatically.

It performs bad-pixel masking, null debiassing, dark subtraction,
flat-field creation and division, and registration using telescope
offsets.  See the L<"NOTES"> for further information.

This recipe aims to keep pace with the pipeline's incoming data and
many options which improve the final mosaic are omitted. This recipe
is suitable for faint objects or objects within a comparatively bright
core embedded in faint extended emission, e.g. a quasar; or extended
objects less than 45 arcseconds across with UFTI and 10 arcseconds
with IRCAM.  If the object is not isolated, there will be artifacts
introduced into the flat field. These arise from the contribution of
sources outside the quadrant containing the primary object.  This
variant of QUADRANT_JITTER is best for isolated objects or where speed
is critical.  Use L<QUADRANT_JITTER|QUADRANT_JITTER> itself if object
masking is required instead.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
created in the headers should no WCS already exist.

=item *

For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.

=item *

The bad-pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item *

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

=item *

The flat field is created iteratively.  First the quadrant
containing the object is masked in each object frame.  Second an
approximate flat field is created by combining the normalised
and masked object frames using the clipped median at each pixel.
This flat field is applied to the object frames.  Sources within
the flat-fielded frames are detected, and masked in the
dark-subtracted frames.  The second stage is repeated but applied
to the masked frames to create the final flat field.

=item *

Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
transformed to pixels.

=item *

The resampling applies non-integer shifts of origin using
bilinear interpolation.  There is no rotation to align the
Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.

=item *

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame.  Thus
the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
less exposure time.  The full signal will be in the central ninth
containing the main object.  The mosaic is not normalised by its
exposure time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).

=item *

For each cycle of four, the recipe creates a mosaic, which is
added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The
exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's corresponding
header.  Likewise the end airmass and end UT headers are updated to
match that of the last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.

=item *

Intermediate frames are deleted except for the flat-fielded (_ff
suffix) frames, and the flat fields.
