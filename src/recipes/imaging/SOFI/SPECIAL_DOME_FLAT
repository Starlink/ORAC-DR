# Name:
#    SPECIAL_DOME_FLAT

# Purpose:
#    Creates and files imaging flat fields derived from a Special Dome flat.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe makes one or more flats for ESO SOFI infrared imaging
#    from a series of special dome flat frames with the calibration lamp
#    alternating on then off, repeated for the mask vignetting
#    the array.  A new flat is made for each combination of filter.
#
#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, then differences
#    each pair of on-off frames after correcting for the shading arising
#    from the different incident fluxes between the lamp on and off
#    frames.  It then normalises the result to a mean of one.  Details of
#    each flat are filed in the index of flats for future selection and
#    use of the flat.  See the "Notes" for further details.

# Notes:
#    -  In addition to the eight frames expected, there may be test
#    frames in the group used to adjust the lamp intensity to an
#    appropriate level.
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The special flat frames are averaged in pairs of like attributes.
#    The attributes being the lamp on or off, and the vignetting mask in
#    place or not.
#    -  Sections in columns 500:600 in both the vignetted (A) and
#    unvignetted (C), and column 50:100 in the vignetted (B) lamp-on
#    frames are collapsed by averaging.  Then the expression A+(C-B) is
#    evaluated, and grown to the full dimensions of the input frame,
#    which in turn is subtracted from the original lamp-on unvignetted
#    averaged frame.  This is the bias-corrected image.
#    -  The previous step is repeated, but for the lamp-off frames.
#    -  The lamp-on bias-corrected frame is subtracted from its lamp-on
#    counterpart, and the result normalised to a mean of 1 to create
#    the flat.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<filter>_<group_number> for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<filter>_<group_number>_c<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent recipe cycles.  Token <filter> is the filter name,
#    <group_number> is the frame number of the group, and <cycle_number>
#    is the number of the cycle, counting from one.
#    -  The flats are filed in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.flat.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [1]

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK
#    and KAPPA.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through the intermediate file

SPECIAL_DOME_FLAT -- Creates and files imaging flat fields derived from a Special Dome flat

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe makes one or more flats for ESO SOFI infrared imaging
from a series of special dome flat frames with the calibration lamp
alternating on then off, repeated for the mask vignetting
the array.  A new flat is made for each combination of filter.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, then differences
each pair of on-off frames after correcting for the shading arising
from the different incident fluxes between the lamp on and off
frames.  It then normalises the result to a mean of one.  Details of
each flat are filed in the index of flats for future selection and
use of the flat.  See the L<"NOTES"> for further details.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

In addition to the eight frames expected, there may be test
frames in the group used to adjust the lamp intensity to an
appropriate level.

=item *

The bad-pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item *

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

=item *

The special flat frames are averaged in pairs of like attributes.
The attributes being the lamp on or off, and the vignetting mask in
place or not.

=item *

Sections in columns 500:600 in both the vignetted (I<A>) and
unvignetted (I<C>), and column 50:100 in the vignetted (I<B>) lamp-on
frames are collapsed by averaging.  Then the expression I<A+(C-B)> is
evaluated, and grown to the full dimensions of the input frame,
which in turn is subtracted from the original lamp-on unvignetted
averaged frame.  This is the bias-corrected image.

=item *

The previous step is repeated, but for the lamp-off frames.

=item *

The lamp-on bias-corrected frame is subtracted from its lamp-on
counterpart, and the result normalised to a mean of 1 to create
the flat.

=item *

Intermediate frames are deleted.

=item *

Sub-arrays are supported.

first or only cycle, and flat_E<lt>filterE<gt>_E<lt>group_numberE<gt>_cE<lt>cycle_numberE<gt>
for subsequent recipe cycles.  Token E<lt>filterE<gt> is the filter name,
E<lt>group_numberE<gt> is the frame number of the group, and E<lt>cycle_numberE<gt>
