=head1 NAME

JITTER - Reduce a standard jitter observation for WFCAM.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe reduces a standard jitter imaging observation for WFCAM
data. It takes an imaging observation comprising jittered (and
optionally microstepped) object frames, a dark frame, and a predetermined
flat-field frame to make a calibrated mosaic automatically.

This recipe performs bad-pixel masking, dark subtraction, flat-field
division, microstep interleaving, and mosaicking.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

You may use SKY_FLAT or SKY_FLAT_MASKED to make the flat field.

=item *

A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is created
in the headers should no WCS already exist.

=item *

A point-source catalogue is created after each interleaved frame is
created.

=item *

For each cycle of jittered frames, the recipe creates a mosaic, which
is then added into a master mosaic of improving signal to noise. The
exposure time is also summed and stored in the mosaic's corresponding
header. Likewise the end airmass and end UT headers are updated to match
that of the last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.

=item DEBAND_TECHNIQUE

Debanding technique to use. Can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. See the _DEBAND_
primitive for more information.
