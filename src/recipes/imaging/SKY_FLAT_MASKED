# Name:
#    SKY_FLAT_MASKED

# Purpose:
#    Creates and files a flat field derived from jittered frames using
#    object masking to reduce artifacts.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe makes a sky flat for UKIRT imaging from a series of sky
#    or object frames which are combined using one of a selection of
#    statistics.  It expects one dark frame followed by jittered sky frames.
#
#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, and dark subtraction
#    before combining the sky frames pixel by pixel to make the flat.  See
#    the "Notes" for further details.  The parameters of the flat are filed
#    in the index of flats for future selection and use of the flat.
#
#    For best results the field observed should contain few stars and no
#    bright ones.  In sparse fields, recipe SKY_FLAT is a faster alternative.

# Notes:
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  For IRCAM, old headers are reordered and structured with
#    headings before groups of related keywords.  The comments have
#    units added or appear in a standard format.  Four deprecated
#    deprecated are removed.  FITS-violating headers are corrected.
#    Spurious instrument names are changed to IRCAM3.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The flat field is created iteratively.  First an approximate
#    flat-field is created by combining normalised sky frames using
#    the median at each pixel.  This flat field is applied to the sky
#    frames.  Sources within the flat-fielded frames are detected, and
#    masked in the dark-subtracted frames.  The first stage is repeated
#    but applied to the masked frames to create the final flat field.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The created flat fields in flat_<filter>_<group_number> for the
#    first or only cycle, and flat_<filter>_<group_number>_c<cycle_number>
#    for subsequent recipe cycles.  Token <filter> is the filter name,
#    <group_number> is the frame number of the group, and <cycle_number>
#    is the number of the cycle, counting from one.
#    -  The flats are filed in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.flat.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the jitter.  If absent, the number of
#       offsets, as given by header NOFFSETS, minus one is used.  If
#       neither is available, 5 is used.  An error state arises if
#       the number of jittered frames is fewer than 3.  []
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [0]

# Timing:

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages CCDPACK,
#    KAPPA, FIGARO, and EXTRACTOR.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format.
#    -  History is recorded within the data files.
#    -  The title of the data is propagated through the intermediate file
#    to the flat.

SKY_FLAT_MASKED -- Creates and files a flat field derived from jittered frames using object masking to reduce artifacts.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe makes a sky flat for UKIRT imaging from a series of sky
or object frames which are combined using one of a selection of
statistics.  It expects one dark frame followed by jittered sky frames.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, and dark subtraction
before combining the sky frames pixel by pixel to make the flat.  See
the L<"NOTES"> for further details.  The parameters of the flat are filed
in the index of flats for future selection and use of the flat.

For best results the field observed should contain few stars and no
bright ones.  In sparse fields, recipe L<SKY_FLAT|SKY_FLAT> is a
faster alternative.

The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
