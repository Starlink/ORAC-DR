# Name:
#    MOVING_NOD_CHOP

# Purpose:
#    Reduces a chopped and nodded observation of a moving target.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This script reduces a chopped and nodded observation, currently
#    just for Michelle data.  It takes an imaging observation
#    comprising a multiple-of-four object frames to make automatically
#    a calibrated, untrimmed mosaic in the reference frame of a moving
#    target.

#    It performs a null debiassing, creation and propagation of data
#    variance, difference the integrations for each AB chop beam pair,
#    bad-pixel masking, difference adjacent nodded pairs, registers the
#    frames, and forms a mosaic.  See the "Notes" for further information.

#    Registration is adjusted to track the motion of the moving
#    target using ephemeris data stored in file target_ephem.dat.
#    See "Ephemeris-file Format" for details of this file's format.

# Notes:
#    -  A variance array is created for each beam, first using the read
#    noise, and once the bias is removed, Poisson noise is added.
#    -  A bias frame selected from the calibration system is removed from
#    each beam in CHOP read mode.  If no bias frame is available
#    in the CHOP mode, the recipe subtracts a null bias, so the errors
#    will be overestimated in the CHOP read mode; the data array will
#    be unaffected once the beams are differenced.  The ARRAY_TESTS
#    recipe files a suitable short-exposure dark as a bias in the
#    calibration system.
#    -  The integrations of the two beams are differenced, the first
#    subtracted from the second in each pair.
#    -  A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
#    created in the headers should no WCS already exist.
#    -  The bad pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Registration is performed using the telescope offsets
#    transformed to pixel, adjusted for the motion of the target, so
#    that the final mosaic registers the target, not the background stars.
#    -  The ephemeris file is specified by environment variable
#    ORAC_EPHEMERIS, defaulting to $ORAC_DATA_OUT/target_ephem.dat.
#    -  The resampling applies integer shifts of origin.   There is no
#    rotation to align the Cartesian axes with the cardinal directions.
#    -  The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity
#    to give the most consistent result amongst the overlapping regions.
#    The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
#    the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
#    less exposure time.  The mosaic is not normalised by its exposure
#    time (that being the exposure time of a single frame).
#    -  For each cycle of object frames, the recipe creates a mosaic,
#    which has its bad pixels filled and is then added into a master
#    mosaic of improving signal to noise.  The exposure time is also
#    summed and stored in the mosaic's corresponding header.  Likewise
#    the end airmass and end UT headers are updated to match that of the
#    last-observed frame contributing to the mosaic.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted except for the differenced pairs
#    (_dp suffix) frames.

# Ephemeris-file Format:
#    The current format of the ephemeris file is one line per object
#    comprising three space-separated fields in the following order:
#      - the objectname, which may contain embedded spaces;
#      - the motion in the plane of the sky in arcsec/second for right
#      ascension then declination.
#
#    Note that the right ascension motion is the change in right ascension
#    multiplied by the cosine of the declination.  The format will change
#    to include UT and possibly date.

# Output Data:
#    -  The integrated mosaic in <m><date>_<group_number>_mos, where <m>
#    is "gm" for Michelle.
#    -  A mosaic for each cycle of object frames in
#    <m><date>_<group_number>_mos<cycle_number>, where <cycle_number>
#    counts from 0.
#    -  The differenced pairs in <i><date>_<obs_number>_dp,
#    where <i> is "m" for Michelle.

# Configurable Steering Parameters:
#    NUMBER = INTEGER
#       The number of frames in the nod pattern.  If absent, the number
#       of offsets, as given by header NOFFSETS, minus one is used.  If
#       neither is available, 4 is used.  An error state arises if
#       the number of jittered frames is fewer than 4 and not a
#       multiple of 4.  []
#    USEVAR = LOGICAL
#       Whether or not to create and propagate variance arrays.  [1]

# Timing:
#    {timing_information}

# Implementation Status:
#    -  The processing engines are from the Starlink packages: CCDPACK,
#    KAPPA, and FIGARO.
#    -  Uses the Starlink NDF format and multi-NDF HDS container files.

MOVING_NOD_CHOP -- Reduces a chopped and nodded observation of a moving target.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reduces a chopped and nodded observation, currently
just for Michelle data.  It takes an imaging observation comprising
a multiple-of-four object frames to make automatically a calibrated,
untrimmed mosaic in the reference frame of a moving target.

It performs a null debiassing, creation and propagation of data
variance, difference the integrations for each AB chop beam pair,
bad-pixel masking, difference adjacent nodded pairs, registers the
frames, and forms a mosaic.  See the L<"NOTES"> for further information.

Registration is adjusted to track the motion of the moving
target using ephemeris data stored in file target_ephem.dat.
See L<"EPHEMERIS-FILE FORMAT"> for details of this file's format.

=item *

A variance array is created for each beam, first using the read
noise, and once the bias is removed, Poisson noise is added.

=item *

A bias frame selected from the calibration system is removed from each
beam in CHOP read mode.  If no bias frame is available in the CHOP
mode, the recipe subtracts a null bias, so the errors will be
overestimated in the CHOP read mode; the data array will be unaffected
once the beams are differenced.  The L<ARRAY_TESTS|ARRAY_TESTS> recipe
files a suitable short-exposure dark as a bias in the calibration
system.

=item *

The integrations of the two beams are differenced, the first
subtracted from the second in each pair.

A World Co-ordinate System (WCS) using the AIPS convention is
created in the headers should no WCS already exist.

The recipe makes the mosaics by applying offsets in intensity

The mosaic is not trimmed to the dimensions of a single frame, thus
the noise will be greater in the peripheral areas having received
