EXTRACT_SLICES

Extracts the spectra from an IFU frame, but does not wavelength
calibrate them or form a datacube.

=head1 Description

This recipe extracts and rearranges the spectra from an IFU frame, but does not apply a wavelength calibration or form a data-cube.

Read-noise and poisson variances are added to the frame and a bad
pixel mask is applied. The spectrum from each slice of the IFU is cut
out of the frame and pasted in a new frame in such a way that there
are no longer spaces between the spectra, the spectra are arranged in
the order in which they appear in the field of view and they are
approximately aligned in the dispersion direction. The spectrum is
then flat-fielded.

=item *

The static arc calibration files contained in $ORAC_DATA_CAL/grisms/
should be formed from frames which have been reduced with this recipe.

=item *

A flat field frame should have been previously reduced and filed with
the calibration system.
