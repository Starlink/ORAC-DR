MAP_EXTENDED_SOURCE

Reduce a group of sky-object pairs of IFU frames, mosaicing datacubes
using telescope offsets.

=head1 Description

This recipe produces a coadded, sky-subtracted, wavelength calibrated,
flux calibrated datacube from a group of sky-object pairs of IFU
frames. The telescope offsets are used to mosaic datacubes together,
allowing a region larger than the field of view of the IFU to be
mapped.

Read-noise and Poisson variances are added to the frame and a bad
pixel mask is applied. The spectrum from each slice of the IFU is cut
out of the frame and pasted in a new frame in such a way that there
are no longer spaces between the spectra, the spectra are arranged in
the order in which they appear in the field of view and they are
approximately aligned in the dispersion direction. The spectrum is
flat-fielded and the wavelength calibration measured from the arc
spectrum is used to apply a common, linear wavelength scale to each
row of the the 2d spectrum.

Sky-object pairs are now subtracted, and the resulting frame is
rearranged to form a data-cube, which is divided by the standard star
spectrum, flux calibrated and mosaiced into the group.

=head1 Notes

=over 4

=item *

A suitable flat-field spectrum, arc spectrum and standard star
spectrum should previously have been reduced and filed with the
calibration system.

=item *

It is recommended that the observation types of the observations are set
to OBJECT and SKY as appropriate. This is inconvenient if you wish to
set up a sequence using an offset iterator in ORAC-OT, so any frames
with a telescope offset greater than the default of 7.5 arcsec will be
assumed to be a sky position. This default can be modified by editing
the SKY_OFFSET parameter passed to the _PAIRWISE_SUBTRACT_NOD_TO_SKY_
primitive.

=item *

Variances are propagated if Kappa 1.0 or later is available. A warning
is displayed if variances are lost.

=item *

Any number of sky-object pairs in any jitter pattern may be used.

=item *

A variant of this recipe, MAP_EXTENDED_SOURCE_NOSTD, is
available which does not divide the spectrum by a standard star or
flux calibrate the spectrum. It may be useful to specify this recipe
on the command line when running ORAC-DR if you choose to defer
observation of your standard until after you have observed your
object.

=head1 Output data

The individual frames with slices extracted and approximately aligned
have the suffix _ext. The flat-fielded, scrunched, sky-subtracted
pairs have the suffix _scr. A datacube is formed from each pair with
the suffix _cub.

The datacubes are mosiaced into a file with the suffix _mos. A white
light image is extracted from this datacube with the suffix _im.
