REDUCE_FLAT

Reduces an IFU flat field

=head1 Description

This recipe is used to reduce an IFU flat-field spectrum. The
normalised flat is filed with the calibration system.

The relative positions of the slice spectra on the array are contained
in a static look-up table. The flat field frame is used to measure the
offset of these positions (they are shifted vertically by different
amounts for different grisms). This too is filed with the calibration
system.

The separate slice spectra are extracted from the frame and rearranged
in a new 2d frame in the correct order (the order in which they cover
the 2d field of view) and approximately aligned in the spectral axis. This 
produces a frame that looks more like a long slit spectrum.

The frame is now treated as a standard long-slit spectrum. The image
is collapsed in the y direction, a black-body spectrum is fitted to this and
all rows of the flat field are divided by this polynomial to remove
the characteristics of the lamp from the flat-field (this does not
have to be done precisely because the same flat-field is used for
object frames and flux calibrators, so it cancels out anyway). The
image is normalised to have a mean value of 1.  The flat field is
filed with the calibration system.

=head1 Notes

=over 4

=item *

Variances are propagated.

=item *

The flat-field accounts for the difference in transmission from one
slice to another as well as pixel to pixel variation. 

=item *

The flat field is used to find the offset between the y-positions of
the spectra from each slice and the positions given in
$ORAC_DATA_CAL/ifu_profile.dat. The offset measured is stored in
index.offset.

=back

=head1 Output data

The normalised flat is stored in flat_<n>, where <n> is
the observation number.
