=head1 NAME

NIGHT_LOG - creates a text log summarising file headers.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe is used to create a text log summarising the file headers
of a group of observations. It is often used to create a log file
describing a whole night's worth of observations.

For full details, see the documentation for the spectroscopy
_NIGHT_LOG_ primitive.

This recipe calls the primitive in such a way that the log file
appears in $ORAC_DATA_IN.

An "on-the-fly" night log is created in $ORAC_DATA_OUT as
spectroscopy data is reduced by the pipeline. This is done by a
call to _NIGHT_LOG_ from _SPECTROSCOPY_HELLO_.
