=head1 NAME

POINT_SOURCE_POL - Reduces spectropolarimetry observations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This primitive reduces polarimetry observations with spectroscopic
data. It takes a spectroscopic observation comprising alternating
object and sky frames at the four waveplate angles 0, 45, 22.5, and
67.5 degrees in turn. It calculates a Stokes hypercube and produces
polarization spectra automatically. See "Output Data" for a list
of these hypercubes and spectra.

It adds read-noise and Poisson distribution noise as a Variance structure,
subtracts an optional bias, interleaves stepped observations, flat-fields,
coadds, adds an estimated wavelength scale, optimally extracts the spectra,
then at the end of a group of eight observations calculates the Stokes
parameters. The polarization data are binned and noisy data excluded
from a final catalogue. See the "Notes" section for details.

This recipe works well for point sources and for extended sources that
still fall within the waveplate.

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

A SpecFrame is added to the extracted spectra and propagated through to
the resulting Stokes spectra.

=item *

Data errors are propagated through all processing steps. The initial
values are found by applying the read-noise and Poisson noise.

=item *

This recipe takes observations in the order 0-degrees object, 0-degrees
sky, 45-degrees sky, 45-degrees object, and so on. Telescope nodding
and waveplate rotation are performed one after the other.

=item *

For each cycle of eight frames, the recipe calculates the Stokes hypercube.
The processing is done with POLPACK, which requires spectropolarimetry
data to be in a 1x1xN cube. The resulting hypercube is of dimensions
1x1xNx3, for I, Q, and U cubes.

=item *

The Stokes cube is used to calculate percentage polarization, polarization
intensity, and polarization intensity.

=HEAD1 OUTPUT DATA

=over 4

=item *

Polarisation frames each inheriting the name of its input frame
but each with a different suffix for the various parameters.
These are:

    sp-I   intensity
    sp-P   percentage polarisation
    sp-PI  polarisation intensity
    sp-Q   Stokes Q
    sp-TH  polarisation angle
    sp-U   Stokes U

=item *

A FITS binary-table catalogue of the binned and culled
polarisation data, called E<lt>groupnameE<gt>_pth.FIT, where
E<lt>groupnameE<gt> is the prefix used for group frames.
For each value it tabulates the x-y-z co-ordinates (x and y
will both be 1, z is the wavelength pixel position), the total
intensity, the Stokes parameters, the
percentage polarisation, the polarisation angle and intensity.
There are additional columns giving the standard deviation on
each of the tabulated values (exlcuding the co-ordinates).
Likewise E<lt>groupnameE<gt>_pol.FIT and
E<lt>groupnameE<gt>_bin.FIT stored the full and binned catalogues
respectively.
