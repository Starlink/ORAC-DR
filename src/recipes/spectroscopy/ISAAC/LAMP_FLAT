# Name:
#    LAMP_FLAT

# Purpose:
#    Creates and files spectroscopic flat fields derived from the
#    calibration lamp.

# Language:
#    Perl5

# Description:
#    This recipe makes one or more sky flats for ISAAC spectroscopy from
#    a series of internal flat frames with the calibration lamp
#    alternating on then off.  A new flat is made for each combination
#    of filter, grating, and central wavelength.

#    It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, then differences
#    each pair of frames.  Once all pairs have been so processed, the
#    recipe normalises and combines all the differenced frames at each
#    instrument setup to form a first pass at the flat.  The slit
#    illumination is then corrected, flagging grossly underilluminated
#    regions as bad.  Details of the flat are filed in the index of flats
#    for future selection and use of the flat.  See the "Notes" for
#    further details.
#
# Notes:
#    -  The bad-pixel mask applied is $ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm.
#    -  Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
#    pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
#    deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
#    The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
#    in the mode used.
#    -  The threshold to mask off under-illuminated areas of the
#    normalised flat, such as at the ends of the slit, is 0.95.
#    -  The illumination correct is performed as follows.  The
#    two-dimensional image is collapsed along columns to form an average
#    one-dimensional spectrum.  A fifth-order polynomial is fit to the
#    one-dimensional spectrum, and a new spectrum is created with this
#    polynomial.  The polynomial spectrum is grown to form an image
#    with dimensions matching the original image.  The original image is
#    divided by the polynomial image.
#    -  Intermediate frames are deleted.
#    -  Sub-arrays are supported.

# Output Data:
#    -  The created flat fields in
#    flat_<filter>_<central_wavelength>_<slit>_<group_number> for the
#    first or only cycle, and _c<cycle_number> is appended for
#    subsequent recipe cycles.  Token <filter> is the filter name,
#    <central_wavelength> is the central wavelength with any decimal

#    is the number of the cycle, counting from one.
#    -  The flats are filed in $ORAC_DATA_OUT/index.flat.

LAMP_FLAT -- Creates and files spectroscopic flat fields derived from the calibration lamp.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This recipe makes one or more sky flats for ISAAC spectroscopy from
a series of internal flat frames with the calibration lamp
alternating on then off.  A new flat is made for each combination
of filter, grating, and central wavelength.

It performs a null debiassing, bad-pixel masking, then differences
each pair of frames.  Once all pairs have been so processed, the
recipe normalises and combines all the differenced frames at each
instrument setup to form a first pass at the flat.  The slit
illumination is then corrected, flagging grossly underilluminated
regions as bad.  Details of the flat are filed in the index of flats
for future selection and use of the flat.  See the L<"NOTES"> for
further details.

=item *

The bad-pixel mask applied is F<$ORAC_DATA_CAL/bpm>.

=item *

Each dark-subtracted frame has thresholds applied beyond which
pixels are flagged as bad.  The lower limit is 5 standard
deviations below the mode, but constrained to the range -100 to 1.
The upper limit is 1000 above the saturation limit for the detector
in the mode used.

=item *

The threshold to mask off under-illuminated areas of the
normalised flat, such as at the ends of the slit, is 0.95.

=item *

The illumination correct is performed as follows.  The
two-dimensional image is collapsed along columns to form an average
one-dimensional spectrum.  A fifth-order polynomial is fit to the
one-dimensiona spectrum, and a new spectrum is created with this
polynomial.  The polynomial spectrum is grown to form an image
with dimensions matching the original image.  The original image is
divided by the polynomial image.

=item *

Intermediate frames are deleted.

Sub-arrays are supported.
