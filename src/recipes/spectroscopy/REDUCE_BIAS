=head1 NAME

REDUCE_BIAS - Reduce a spectrocopy BIAS observation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reduces a spectroscopy BIAS observation, including coadding multiple
integrations. Files the reduced bias frame for use by subsequent
reduction of STARE and CHOP mode data.

=head1 NOTES

Creates a variance array for the bias frame, determined from the
variance of the multiple integrations in the bias observation. There
should be at least 3 integrations in a BIAS observation.
