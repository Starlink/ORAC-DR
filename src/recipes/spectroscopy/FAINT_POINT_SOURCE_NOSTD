=head1 NAME

FAINT_POINT_SOURCE_NOSTD - FAINT_POINT_SOURCE but without division by
a standard star.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See the FAINT_POINT_SOURCE recipe documentation. This version is identical
except that it does not use a standard star, and thus processing stops
after extraction of the spectrum from the group frame.

If you acquire suitable standard star observations later in the night,
you should reduce them first, then re-process your target data with
the FAINT_POINT_SOURCE recipe.

Note that to be suitable, such data must be taken before driving
of the spectrometer optics motors. You cannot change configurations
in between.
