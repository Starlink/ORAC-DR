=head1 NAME

SOURCE_WITH_NOD_TO_BLANK_SKY - Extended source reduction on stable sky.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The default 'nod to blank sky' recipe. Use for extended sources.
Requires you to have allready taken a flat field and a standard star.

Reduces the data, estimating the wavelength calibration, optimally
extracts the spectrum and uses the previously observed standard star
for flux calibration.

=head1 NOTE

When using this recipe, you must have a sequence that takes a SKY
frame I<BEFORE> it takes the first object frame; otherwise, the
pipeline will fail as it will be unable to reduce the first object
frame as it won't be able to sky subtract. I suggest using the sequence
SKY-OBJECT-OBJECT-SKY rather then the normal OBJECT-SKY-SKY-OBJECT.
