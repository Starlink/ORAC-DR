=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item *

All shared memory owned by the current user is removed even if
it is not directly associated with an ORAC-DR process.

=item *

Will not attempt to remove shared memory owned by another user.

=item *

Will attempt to kill processes owned by other users even though
this will not succeed unless the user has special privilege.

=item *

Does not attempt to clear out ADAM_USER directories. This is not
normally a problem for ORAC-DR since each ORAC-DR process works
in a different ADAM_USER directory.
