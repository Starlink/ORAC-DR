=head1 NAME

ORAC::Calib::SCUBA2 - SCUBA-2 calibration object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Calib::SCUBA2;

  $Cal = new ORAC::Calib::SCUBA2;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module returns (and can be used to set) calibration information
for SCUBA-2.

It can also be used to set and retrieve lists of bad bolometers generated
by noise observations.

This class does inherit from B<ORAC::Calib> although nearly all the
methods in the base class are irrelevant to SCUBA-2 (this class only
uses the thing() method).

Note that currently this module is mostly just a copy of the SCUBA
module, with extra SCUBA-2 specific methods. Some pruning/updating
WILL be necessary.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following methods are available in this class.
These are in addition to the methods inherited from B<ORAC::Calib>.

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

Create a new instance of a ORAC::Calib::SCUBA2 object.
The object identifier is returned.

  $Cal = new ORAC::Calib::SCUBA2;

=cut

# NEW - create new instance of Calib

sub new {
  my $self = shift;
  my $obj = $self->SUPER::new( @_ );

# This assumes we have a hash object
  $obj->{Beam} = {},           # Current best-fit beam parameters
  $obj->{FWHM} = undef,        # Current mean main-beam FWHM
  $obj->{SkyRefImage} = undef; # Name of current reference image

  # Specify default tausys
  $obj->tausys( "CSO" );

  return $obj;
}

=back

=head2 Accessor Methods

=over 4

=item B<default_fcfs>

Return the default FCF lookup table indexed by filter.

 %FCFS = $cal->default_fcfs();

=cut

sub default_fcfs {
  return %FCFS;
}

=item B<secondary_calibrator_fluxes>

Return the lookup table of fluxes for secondary calibrators. Takes an
optional parameter which returns the total fluxes rather than the `per
beam' values.

 %photfluxes = $cal->secondary_calibrator_fluxes( $ismap );

=cut

sub secondary_calibrator_fluxes {
  my $self = shift;
  my $ismap = shift if (@_);
  return (defined $ismap && $ismap) ? %ASECFLUXES : %BEAMFLUXES;
}

=item B<subinst>

The sub-instrument associated with this calibration object.
Options are "450" or "850".

  $subinst = $Cal->subinst();

=cut

sub subinst {
   my $self = shift;
   my $thingref = $self->thingone;
   return ( $thingref->{FILTER}  =~ /^85/ ? "850" : 450);
}

=item B<fwhm>

A simple method to set or retrieve the beam full-width-at-half-maximum
(FWHM). If the complete beam parameters are required, the B<beam>
method should be used instead. If the FWHM is undef then a hard-wired
default value, appropriate for the current wavelength, is returned.

  $Cal->fwhm( $fwhm );

  my $fwhm = $Cal->fwhm;

=cut

sub fwhm {
  my $self = shift;

  # Set
  if ( @_ ) {
    $self->{FWHM} = shift;
    return;
  }

  # Get
  my $fwhm = (defined $self->{FWHM}) ? $self->{FWHM} : 0;

  if ( $fwhm == 0 ) {
    my $thingref = $self->thingone;
    $fwhm = ( $self->subinst() eq '850') ? 14.0 : 7.5;
  }
  return $fwhm;
}

=item B<fwhm_eff>

Returns the FWHM (in arcsec) of a Gaussian with the same area as the
telescope beam (see the B<beamarea> method below).

  $fwhm_eff = $Cal->fwhm_eff;

=cut

sub fwhm_eff {
  my $self = shift;
  return sqrt($self->beamarea/1.133);
}

=item B<beamarea>

Returns the beam area in units of arcsec^2/beam. The nominal
values have been determined empirically from an ensemble
of calibration data.

  $beamarea = $Cal->beamarea();

The optional parameter is an aperture diameter in arcsec:

  $beamarea = $Cal->beamarea( $diam );

This value can be thought of as an ideal Gaussian of FWHM
sqrt(beamarea/1.133). It will be slightly bigger than the
nominal FWHM of the primary beam because error lobes are
included.

=cut

sub beamarea {
  my $self = shift;
  my $diam = shift;

  # Now the defaults
  # Note that this is actually a function of aperture diameter
  # but we currently do not have enough information for that.
  my $ba;
  if ($self->subinst() eq '850') {
    $ba = 229.75;
  } else {
    $ba = 100.0;
  }
  return $ba;
}

=item B<beampar>

A method to set or retrieve the full parameter set for the most recent
fit to the beam. If setting the beam parameters, all of the parameters
must be specified. The beam dimensions and orientation must be passed
as array references. A hash reference containing the beam parameters
is returned.

  $Cal->beampar( majfwhm => \@majfwhm, minfwhm => \@minfwhm,
		 orient => \@orient, errfrac => $errfrac );

  my $beampar_ref = $Cal->beampar;

Conventionally the units of the FWHM are arcsec, but it is up to the
caller to ensure that the FWHM values are in the units of choice
before storing them here.

=cut

sub beampar {
  my $self = shift;

  # $self->beam is a hash reference. What should the keys be?
  # BMAJ => val
  # BMAJERR => val
  # BMIN => val
  # BMINERR => val
  # PA => val
  # PAERR => val
  # ErrFrac => val

  if ( @_ ) {
    my %beamargs = @_;

    # What if any of these is undef?
    $self->{Beam}->{Bmaj} = $beamargs{majfwhm}->[0];
    $self->{Beam}->{BmajErr} = $beamargs{majfwhm}->[1];
    $self->{Beam}->{Bmin} = $beamargs{minfwhm}->[0];
    $self->{Beam}->{BminErr} = $beamargs{minfwhm}->[1];
    $self->{Beam}->{Pa} = $beamargs{orient}->[0];
    $self->{Beam}->{PaErr} = $beamargs{orient}->[1];

    $self->{Beam}->{ErrFrac} = $beamargs{errfrac};

    return;
  }

  return $self->{Beam};

}

=item B<nep_spec>

Method to return the NEP spec for the current wavelength

=cut

sub nep_spec {

  my $self = shift;
  my $nepkey = $self->subinst();

  return $NEP{$nepkey};
}

=item B<refimage>

Method to store or retrieve current reference image. The method
requires two arguments: the group name and the name of the reference
image. Currently, the group name is not used, but that may change in
the future.

  $Cal->refimage( $group_name, $refimage );

  my $refimage = $Cal->refimage;

=cut

sub refimage {
  my $self = shift;

  if ( @_ ) {
    my ( $group, $refimage ) = @_;
    $self->{SkyRefImage} = $refimage;
    return;
  }

  return $self->{SkyRefImage};
}

=item B<mask>

Return (or set) the name of the current bad bolometer mask.

  $mask = $Cal->mask;

This method is subclassed for SCUBA-2 because we have one mask per
subarray and not one standard mask. Note that the user must set the
subarray with the Frame class C<subarray()> method before a suitable
calibration entry can be found. This is due to the fact that it is not
possible to search the Frame subheaders when evaluating the rules.

=cut

sub mask {
  my $self = shift;

=item B<dark>

Return (or set) the name of the current dark frame.

  $dark = $Cal->dark;

This method is subclassed for SCUBA-2 because we have dark frames for
each subarray. Note that the user must set the subarray with the Frame
class C<subarray()> method before a suitable calibration entry can be
found. This is due to the fact that it is not possible to search the
Frame subheaders when evaluating the rules.

=item B<flat>

Return (or set) the name of the current flatfield solution.

  $flat = $Cal->flat;

This method is subclassed for SCUBA-2 because we have one flatfield
per subarray. Note that the user must set the subarray with the Frame
class C<subarray()> method before a suitable calibration entry can be
found. This is due to the fact that it is not possible to search the
Frame subheaders when evaluating the rules.

=item B<fastflat>

Return (or set) the name of the current fast-ramp flatfield file(s).

  $fastflat = $Cal->fastflat;

There is one fast-ramp flatfield file per subarray. Note that the user
must set the subarray with the Frame class C<subarray()> method before
a suitable calibration entry can be found. This is due to the fact
that it is not possible to search the Frame subheaders when evaluating
the rules.

=item B<setupflat>

Return the name of the matching fast-ramp flatfield file from the most
recent C<SETUP> observation.

  $setupflat = $Cal->setupflat;

There is one fast-ramp flatfield file per subarray. Note that the user
must set the subarray with the Frame class C<subarray()> method before
a suitable calibration entry can be found. This is due to the fact
that it is not possible to search the Frame subheaders when evaluating
the rules.

=item B<noise>

Return the name of the matching noise observation.

  $noise = $Cal->noise;

There is one noise file per subarray. Note that the user must set the
subarray with the Frame class C<subarray()> method before a suitable
entry can be found. This is due to the fact that it is not possible to
search the Frame subheaders when evaluating the rules.

=item B<nep>

Return the name of the matching NEP file. This returns the name of the
top-level container file - the user must then select the
C<.more.smurf.nep> component within that file.

  $nep = $Cal->nep;

There is one noise file per subarray. Note that the user must set the
subarray with the Frame class C<subarray()> method before a suitable
entry can be found. This is due to the fact that it is not possible to
search the Frame subheaders when evaluating the rules.

=item B<pixelscale>

Method to retrieve default values of the pixel scale for output
images. The numbers are returned in ARCSEC. These numbers are
hard-wired here and should always be retrieved with this
method.

=item B<resp>

Return (or set) the name of the current responsivity solution.

  $resp = $Cal->resp;

Note that unless the current Frame has been derived from a sub-group,
the user must set the subarray with the Frame class C<subarray()>
method before a suitable calibration entry can be found. This is due
to the fact that it is not possible to search the Frame subheaders
when evaluating the rules.

sub resp {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->GenericIndexAccessor( "resp", 0, 0, 0, 1, @_ );
}

=item B<respstats>

Get/set the statistics associated with the most recent flatfield
solution. If setting, the user must supply a subarray and hash
reference with the relevant statistics. No check is made to verify the
contents of the hash. The user may pass in an optional subarray
argument if retrieving the stored values, otherwise the entire hash
reference is returned. If so then a hash reference is returned whicih
contains only the relevant info for the given subarray. A value of
undef is returned if no data exist for that subarray.

  my %allrespstats = %{ $Cal->respstats };

=item B<beam>

Returns the beamsize associated with the supplied array.

  @beam = $Cal->beam($arr);

The values returned are FWHM major axis, FWHM minor axis, PA.

=item B<makemap_config>

Return the full path to a default makemap config file. Options to
return particular default configurations may be passed in as a
hash. Valid keys are C<config_type> and C<pipeline>. The config type
must be one of the supported values (see the contents of
$STARLINK_DIR/share/smurf for available options). If given, the
pipeline argument must be either C<ql> or C<summit> and causes this
method to look in the directory defined by the environment variable
ORAC_DATA_CAL.

  my $config_file = $Cal->makemap_config;
  my $config_file = $Cal->makemap_config( pipeline => "ql" );

The C<config_type> is usually stored as a uhdr entry for the current
Frame object.

The C<pipeline> argument is ignored if the config type is given as C<moon>.

=cut

=head2 Support Methods

The "mask" and "resp" methods have support implementations to obtain
the index file, current name and whether the value can be updated
or not. For method "cal" there will be corresponding methods
"calindex", "calname" and "calnoupdate". "calcache" is an
allowed synonym for "calname".

  $current = $Cal->calcache();
  $index = $Cal->calindex();
  $noup = $Cal->calnoupdate();
