=head1 NAME

ORAC::Calib::SCUBA2 - SCUBA-2 calibration object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Calib::SCUBA2;

  $Cal = new ORAC::Calib::SCUBA2;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module returns (and can be used to set) calibration information
for SCUBA-2.

It can also be used to set and retrieve lists of bad bolometers generated
by noise observations.

This class does inherit from B<ORAC::Calib> although nearly all the
methods in the base class are irrelevant to SCUBA-2 (this class only
uses the thing() method).

Note that currently this module is mostly just a copy of the SCUBA
module, with extra SCUBA-2 specific methods. Some pruning/updating
WILL be necessary.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following methods are available in this class.
These are in addition to the methods inherited from B<ORAC::Calib>.

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

Create a new instance of a ORAC::Calib::SCUBA2 object.
The object identifier is returned.

  $Cal = new ORAC::Calib::SCUBA2;

=cut

# NEW - create new instance of Calib

sub new {
  my $self = shift;
  my $obj = $self->SUPER::new( @_ );

  # This assumes we have a hash object
  if (defined $obj && ref($obj) eq "HASH") {
    $obj->{BeamFit} = undef;        # Current best-fit beam parameters (hash ref)
    $obj->{ErrBeamFit} = undef;     # Current fit to error beam (hash ref)
    $obj->{FWHMfit} = undef;        # Most recent fitted mean FWHM (scalar)
    $obj->{FWHMerr} = undef;        # Most recent fitted FWHM of error beam (scalar)
    $obj->{ErrFrac} = undef;        # Most recent estimate of error beam fraction
  }

  # Specify default tausys
  $obj->tausys( "CSO" );

  return $obj;
}

=head2 Accessor Methods

=over 4

=item B<beamcomp>

Return the number of components in the current fit to the beam. Will
be either 1 or 2 if a fit exists, otherwise undef.

  my $ncomp = $Cal->beamcomp();

=cut

sub beamcomp {
  my $self = shift;
  my $ncomp;
  if ($self->beamfit) {
    my $beamfit = $self->beamfit;
    $ncomp = $beamfit->{BeamComp};
  }
  return $ncomp;
}

=item B<beamfit>

A method to set or retrieve the full parameter set for the most recent
fit to the beam. If setting the beam parameters, all of the parameters
must be specified as a hash. The beam dimensions and orientation must
be passed as array references. A hash reference containing the beam
parameters is returned.

  $Cal->beamfit( majfwhm => \@majfwhm, minfwhm => \@minfwhm,
		 orient => \@orient, gamma => $gamma );

  $Cal->beamfit( %beamfit );

  my $beamfit_ref = $Cal->beamfit;

The returned hash reference has the following keys: C<BeamA>,
C<BeamAErr>, C<BeamB>, C<BeamBErr>, C<PA>, C<PAErr>, C<FWHM>, C<Gamma>
and C<BeamComp>. C<BeamA> and C<BeamB> are the major and minor axes
respectively of the first component of the fit. In the case of a
two-component fit, the FWHM of the second component (and its
uncertainty) is stored by the C<errbeam> method. The C<FWHM> entry
contains the geometric mean of the major and minor axes of the first
component. C<Gamma> will always be 2 if there are two components.

Conventionally the units of the FWHM are arcsec, but it is up to the
caller to ensure that the FWHM values are in the units of choice
before storing them here.

  my $self = shift;

    $self->errbeam({BeamA => $majfwhm[2], BeamAErr => $majfwhm[3]});
  }

  return $self->{BeamFit};
}

=item B<errbeam>

The current estimated FWHM of the error beam (and its uncertainty) as
given in the C<beampar> results. Must be given and returns a hash
reference with the keys C<BeamA> and C<BeamAErr>.

  $Cal->errbeam({BeamA => $fwhm, BeamAErr => $fwhm_err});
  my $errbeam = $Cal->errbeam;

    $self->fwhm_err($self->{ErrBeamFit}->{BeamA});
  }
  return $self->{ErrBeamFit};
}

=item B<errfrac>

Fractional power in the error beam as determined from aperture photometry.

  $Cal->errfrac($errfrac);
  my $errfrac = $Cal->errfrac;

=cut

sub errfrac {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    $self->{ErrFrac} = shift;
  }
  return $self->{ErrFrac};
}

=item B<fwhm_err>

Returns the FWHM of the current estimate of the error beam.

  $Cal->fwhm_err($fwhm_err);
  my $fwhm_err = $Cal->fwhm_err;

=cut

sub fwhm_err {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    $self->{FWHMerr} = shift;
  }
  return $self->{FWHMerr};
}

=item B<fwhm_fit>

Retrieve the fitted beam full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM). Returns
the geometric mean of the major/minor axes of the fit.

  my $fitted_fwhm = $Cal->fwhm_fit;
  $Cal->fwhm_fit($fwhm);

If the complete beam parameters are required, the B<beamfit>
method should be used instead. Returns undef if no fit parameters have
been stored.

  }
  return $self->{FWHMfit};

=head2 Instance methods

=over 4

=item B<beam>

Return the telescope beam parameters for the current wavelength. See
the C<beamfit> method for the results of the most recent fit to the

=item B<beamamps>

Return the relative amplitudes of the telescope beam components at the
current wavelength. Returns either an array with two elements or array
reference depending on caller. The first element corresponds to the
main beam component.

=item B<beamarea>

Returns the beam area in units of arcsec^2/beam. The nominal
values have been determined empirically from an ensemble
of calibration data.

  $beamarea = $Cal->beamarea();

The optional parameter is an aperture diameter in arcsec:

  $beamarea = $Cal->beamarea( $diam );

This value can be thought of as an ideal Gaussian of FWHM
sqrt(beamarea/1.133). It will be slightly bigger than the
nominal FWHM of the primary beam because error lobes are
included.

  # Note that this is actually a function of aperture diameter
  # but we currently do not have enough information for that.
  return $BEAMAREA{$self->subinst()};

=item B<beamfrac>

Return the fractional power in each component of the beam as an array
or array reference. May also take parameter to return either the main
or error beam fraction.

Return the default FCF lookup table indexed by filter.

 %FCFS = $cal->default_fcfs();

=cut

sub default_fcfs {
  return %FCFS;
}

=item B<fwhm>

Return the measured telescope beam FWHM for the two components at the
current wavelength. Returns either an array with two elements or array
reference depending on caller. The first element is the main beam
component.

  my $fwhm = $Cal->fwhm;
  my @fwhm = $Cal->fwhm;

}

=item B<fwhm_eff>

Returns the FWHM (in arcsec) of a Gaussian with the same area as the
empirical telescope beam (see the B<beamarea> method below).

  $fwhm_eff = $Cal->fwhm_eff;

=cut

=item B<secondary_calibrator_fluxes>

Return the lookup table of fluxes for secondary calibrators. Takes an
optional parameter which returns the total fluxes rather than the `per
beam' values.

 %photfluxes = $cal->secondary_calibrator_fluxes( $ismap );

=head2 Index Methods

=over 4

=item B<mask>

Return (or set) the name of the current bad bolometer mask.

  $mask = $Cal->mask;

This method is subclassed for SCUBA-2 because we have one mask per
subarray and not one standard mask. Note that the user must set the
subarray with the Frame class C<subarray()> method before a suitable
calibration entry can be found. This is due to the fact that it is not
possible to search the Frame subheaders when evaluating the rules.

}

=item B<dark>

Return (or set) the name of the current dark frame.

  $dark = $Cal->dark;

This method is subclassed for SCUBA-2 because we have dark frames for
each subarray. Note that the user must set the subarray with the Frame
class C<subarray()> method before a suitable calibration entry can be
found. This is due to the fact that it is not possible to search the
Frame subheaders when evaluating the rules.

=item B<flat>

Return (or set) the name of the current flatfield solution.

  $flat = $Cal->flat;

This method is subclassed for SCUBA-2 because we have one flatfield
per subarray. Note that the user must set the subarray with the Frame
class C<subarray()> method before a suitable calibration entry can be
found. This is due to the fact that it is not possible to search the
Frame subheaders when evaluating the rules.

=item B<fastflat>

Return (or set) the name of the current fast-ramp flatfield file(s).

  $fastflat = $Cal->fastflat;

There is one fast-ramp flatfield file per subarray. Note that the user
must set the subarray with the Frame class C<subarray()> method before
a suitable calibration entry can be found. This is due to the fact
that it is not possible to search the Frame subheaders when evaluating
the rules.

Return the name of the matching fast-ramp flatfield file from the most
recent C<SETUP> observation.

  $setupflat = $Cal->setupflat;

There is one fast-ramp flatfield file per subarray. Note that the user
must set the subarray with the Frame class C<subarray()> method before
a suitable calibration entry can be found. This is due to the fact
that it is not possible to search the Frame subheaders when evaluating
the rules.

=item B<noise>

Return the name of the matching noise observation.

  $noise = $Cal->noise;

There is one noise file per subarray. Note that the user must set the
subarray with the Frame class C<subarray()> method before a suitable
entry can be found. This is due to the fact that it is not possible to
search the Frame subheaders when evaluating the rules.

=cut

  my $warn = 0;
  return $self->GenericIndexAccessor( "noise", -1, 1, 0, $warn, @_ );

Return the name of the matching NEP file. This returns the name of the
top-level container file - the user must then select the
C<.more.smurf.nep> component within that file.

  $nep = $Cal->nep;

There is one noise file per subarray. Note that the user must set the
subarray with the Frame class C<subarray()> method before a suitable

=head2 General Methods

=over 4

=item B<makemap_config>

Return the full path to a default makemap config file. Options to
return particular default configurations may be passed in as a
hash. Valid keys are C<config_type> and C<pipeline>. The config type
must be one of the supported values (see the contents of
$STARLINK_DIR/share/smurf for available options). If given, the
pipeline argument must be either C<ql> or C<summit> and causes this
method to look in the directory defined by the environment variable
ORAC_DATA_CAL.

  my $config_file = $Cal->makemap_config;
  my $config_file = $Cal->makemap_config( pipeline => "ql" );

The C<config_type> is usually stored as a uhdr entry for the current
Frame object.

The C<pipeline> argument is ignored if the config type is given as C<moon>.

=cut

=item B<pixelscale>

Method to retrieve default values of the pixel scale for output
images. The numbers are returned in ARCSEC. These numbers are
hard-wired here and should always be retrieved with this
method.

Note this is intended for use with DREAM/STARE images, not SCAN data.

=cut

=item B<resp>

Return (or set) the name of the current responsivity solution.

  $resp = $Cal->resp;

Note that unless the current Frame has been derived from a sub-group,
the user must set the subarray with the Frame class C<subarray()>
method before a suitable calibration entry can be found. This is due
to the fact that it is not possible to search the Frame subheaders
when evaluating the rules.

=cut

sub resp {
  my $self = shift;

=item B<respstats>

Get/set the statistics associated with the most recent flatfield
solution. If setting, the user must supply a subarray and hash
reference with the relevant statistics. No check is made to verify the
contents of the hash. The user may pass in an optional subarray
argument if retrieving the stored values, otherwise the entire hash
reference is returned. If so then a hash reference is returned whicih
contains only the relevant info for the given subarray. A value of
undef is returned if no data exist for that subarray.

  my %allrespstats = %{ $Cal->respstats };

  my $respstatsref = $Cal->respstats( $subarray );

=head2 Support Methods

The "mask" and "resp" methods have support implementations to obtain
the index file, current name and whether the value can be updated
or not. For method "cal" there will be corresponding methods
"calindex", "calname" and "calnoupdate". "calcache" is an
allowed synonym for "calname".
