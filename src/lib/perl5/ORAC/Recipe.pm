=head1 METHODS

The following methods are available:

=head2 Constructor

=over 4

=item B<new>

The constructor instantiates a new object and, if the recipe name and
instrument are given, reads the recipe from disk.

  $r = new ORAC::Recipe;
  $r = new ORAC::Recipe( NAME => $name,
                         INSTRUMENT => $instrument );

The instrument name is required in order to configure the recipe
search path.

=head2 Accessor Methods

=over 4

=item B<parser>

Recipe and primitive parser object used to do the real low level parsing.
Automatically instantiated on demand.

  $parser = $rec->parser();

Will be a C<ORAC::Recipe::PrimitiveParser>.

=cut

sub parser {
  my $self = shift;
  $self->{PrimitiveParser} = ORAC::Recipe::PrimitiveParser->new()
    unless defined $self->{PrimitiveParser};
  return $self->{PrimitiveParser};
}

=item B<recipe>

The actual recipe. Actually will be an C<ORAC::Recipe::Primitive>
object (since at the code level there is no difference).

 $data = $rec->recipe;

=cut

sub recipe {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    my $recipe = shift;
    if (defined $recipe) {
      throw ORAC::Error::FatalError("Must be an ORAC::Recipe::Primitive object")
        unless $recipe->isa("ORAC::Recipe::Primitive");
    }
    $self->{Recipe} = $recipe;
  }
  return $self->{Recipe};
}

=item B<name>

Recipe name. Will trigger a read of the recipe if an instrument is
available. If a compiled recipe is available the method will be delegated
to that object.

  $name = $rec->name;
  $rec->name( $name [, $no_read] );

The additional C<no_read> parameter can be used to disable automatic reading.

=cut

sub name {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    # we are setting a name
    $self->{RecipeName} = shift;
    my $no_read = shift // 0;

  # if we have a compiled recipe ask that
  if (defined $self->recipe) {
    return $self->recipe->name;
  } else {
    return $self->{RecipeName};
  }
}

=item B<suffices>

Suffices that can be appended to recipe name when scanning for recipes. The recipe containing
a suffix is used in preference to a recipe without the suffix. The suffices are stored in
priority order.

  @suffices = $rec->suffices;
  $rec->suffices( @suffices );

Note that suffices do not need to start with an underscore and one will be added if required.
All recipes will be STUB_SUFFIX form.

=cut

sub suffices {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    # prepend underscore if needed so that we only do it once rather than each time we look
    # for a recipe
    @{$self->{RecSuffices}} = map { $_ = "_$_" unless /^_/; $_} @_;
  }
  return @{$self->{RecSuffices}};
}

=item B<parameters>

General ORAC::Recipe::Parameters object, not parameters necesarily
associated with this recipe.

  $par = $rec->parameters

=cut

# Store the full object here in case we would wish to add
# primitive parameters that could be injected by the parser

sub parameters {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    $self->{RecParams} = shift;
  }
  return $self->{RecParams};
}

=item B<batch>

Set or return the batch processing status. If batch is set to true
the recipe will process groups that have been pre-populated with
unprocessed frames..

  $batch = $rec->batch;

=cut

sub batch {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    $self->{BATCH} = shift;
  }
  ;
  return $self->{BATCH};
}

=item B<debug>

Set or return the debug status. If debug is set to true
the processed recipe will include additional debug statements.

  $rec->debug(1);

=cut

# Delegate debugging to the Parser

sub debug {
  my $self = shift;
  my $parser = $self->parser();
  return $parser->debug(@_);
}

=item B<frame>

Set or return the C<ORAC::Frame> associated with the recipe execution.
This controls

  $rec->frame($Frm);

=cut

# Delegate to the Parser

sub frame {
  my $self = shift;
  my $parser = $self->parser();
  return $parser->frame(@_);
}

=item B<instrument>

Set or return the instrument name. This is required to configure
search paths to determine recipe and primitive location.

  $inst = $rec->instrument;

If set, the parser object is updated automatically.

=cut

# Delegate to the Parser object since it does not really do us any
# good to have a scheme where they can differ

sub instrument {
  my $self = shift;
  my $parser = $self->parser();
  return $parser->instrument( @_ );
}

=item B<primitives>

Returns all the primitives that are referenced by this recipe.

 @prim = $rec->primitives;

=cut

sub primitives {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->_read_all_prims( 1 );
}

=item B<options>

Set or return recipe parsing options.

If set, the parser object is also updated.

=cut

sub options {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    my $options = shift // {};
    $self->{Options} = $options;
    $self->parser()->options($options);

Returns the full recipe as a single string.

 $string = $rec->as_string();

  # Force the recipe to be read
  $self->_read_recipe;

  # The recipe is easy

=item B<check_syntax>

Loads and compiles each primitive in the recipe.

A Frame object may be required for some instruments.

  $rec->check_syntax;

Returns an array of all the primitives used by the recipe (in the order in which they
were loaded).

  @primitives = $rec->check_syntax;

  }
  return @primitives;
}


=item B<execute>

Executes the recipes stored in the object.
Also needs the current frame, group and calibration objects
as well as the hash containing all the messaging objects.

  $rec->execute( \$CURRENT_RECIPE, \$CURRENT_PRIMITIVE, \$PRIMITIVE_LIST,
                 $Frm, $Grp, $Cal, $Display, \%Mon);

The following classes are avaiable to primitive writers:

  ORAC::Print, ORAC::LogFile, ORAC::General, ORAC::Constants,
  ORAC::TempFile, Starlink::Versions, LWP::Simple and IO::File.

Other classes can be loaded from within the recipe as needed.

Returns the recipe exit status or throws an exception.

The objects accessible to the recipe are:

=over 4

=item B<$CURRENT_RECIPE>

Reference to string describing the current recipe. Passed in here
because the executed recipe can be different from the requested
recipe. Will be set with the value:

  Currently doing: $RecipeName

=item B<$CURRENT_PRIMITIVE>

Reference to an array containing a list of currently running
primitives.

=item B<$Frm>

The current frame object to be processed. This is of
class C<ORAC::Frame> (or subclass thereof).

=item B<$Grp>

The group object associated with the current frame to be
processed. This is of class C<ORAC::Group> (or subclass thereof).
The C<<$ORAC_Recipe_Info->{Batch}>> variable controls how many frames are visible
to the group object.

=item B<$Cal>

The calibration object to use for this frame. This is of
class C<ORAC::Calib> (or subclass thereof).

=item B<$Display>

The object associated with the ORAC Display system. This
is of class C<ORAC::Display>. The display system has not been
initialised if this variable has a value of undef. Primitives
should check to see that the variable is defined before
attempting to use it.

=back

The following global variables are also available to the recipe:

=over 4

=item B<%Mon>

Hash containing all the algorithm engine objects.

=item B<$ORAC_Recipe_Info>

Reference to a hash containing information that may be of use
to the primitive. Keys are

  Batch - flag to indicate that batch mode is enabled
  Name  - name of the recipe that was loaded.

=back

The namespace in which the recipe is executed is not specified
and may change at any time.

Read the recipe from disk and pass to the parser.

The instrument, frame object and recipe name must be set in the object for optimal
parsing. The frame object can be left out in some cases (eg if a parse test
is being performed). An error will occur during execution if the frame object is required.

The search path is set from the instrument name and from the
C<ORAC_RECIPE_DIR> environment variable. The C<ORAC_RECIPE_DIR>
environment variable is similar to a normal C<PATH> variable in that
multiple directories can be supplied if separated by colons.

Croaks if the recipe could not be found or opened. Returns ORAC__OK
on success.

=item B<get_prim_arg>

Retrieve a primitive argument safely using exists and defined
and if necessary returning the supplied default.

  my $val = get_prim_arg( $_PRIM_ARGS_, $key, $default, $error_if_undef );

The fourth argument is optional. If it is defined and true, then an
error will be thrown (via orac_term) if the primitive argument is
undefined.

sub get_prim_arg {
  my $argref = shift;
  my $key = shift;
  my $default = shift;
  my $error_if_undef = shift;

  if( defined( $error_if_undef ) && $error_if_undef &&
      ( ! exists( $argref->{$key} ) || ! defined( $argref->{$key} ) ) ) {
    my ( $package, $filename, $line ) = caller;
    orac_term( "$key argument to $filename must be defined! Programming error!" );
  }

  return (exists $argref->{$key} && defined $argref->{$key})
    ? $argref->{$key} : $default;
}

=item B<orac_execute_recipe>

Simple wrapper to eval in this namespace in order to execute recipes
without fear of possible contamination of the base recipe namespace.

  $status = orac_execute_recipe( $CURRENT_PRIMITIVE, $Recipe, $Frm, $Grp,
                                 $Cal, $Display, $Mon);

The recipe is a C<ORAC::Recipe> object. The basic objects have to
be supplied since they can not be set inside the recipe prior to
execution (the stringified objects have no meaning). The debug and
batch variables are passed in as recipe globals.

Note that $DEBUG in recipes and primitives is set during compile time and
not during execution.

The ORAC_DR_RECIPE user header of the Frame and Group objects are updated
to reflect the name of the actual recipe being used.

=item B<current_primitive>

Class method to set the current primitive during execution.

  ORAC::Recipe::Execution->current_primitive( $primitive_name, \@callers );

The caller array allows nested trees to be processed correctly if required and contains
the full call stack. Each element is a reference to an array containing the calling primitive
name and line number and the number of times this primitive was called from the caller.
