=head1 NAME

ORAC::Group - base class for dealing with observation groups in ORAC-DR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ORAC::Group;

  $Grp = new ORAC::Group("groupid");

  $Grp->file("Group_file_name");
  $group_name = $Grp->name;
  $Grp->push($frame);
  $total_in_group = $Grp->num;
  $frame3 = $Grp->frame(2);
  @good_members = $Grp->members;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the basic methods available to all
B<ORAC::Group> objects. This class should be used when
storing information relating to a group of observations
processed in the B<ORAC-DR> data reduction pipeline.

Groups are composed of frame objects (B<ORAC::Frame>)
or objects that can perform those methods.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

The following methods are available in this class.

=head2 Constructors

The following constructors are available:

=over 4

=item B<new>

Create a new instance of a B<ORAC::Group> object.
This method takes an optional argument containing the
identifier of the new group. The object identifier is returned.

   $Grp = new ORAC::Group;
   $Grp = new ORAC::Group("group_id");

   $Grp = new ORAC::Group("group_id", $filename );

The base class constructor should be invoked by sub-class constructors.
If this method is called with the last argument as a reference to
a hash it is assumed that this hash contains extra configuration
information ('instance' information) supplied by sub-classes.

}

=item B<subgrp>

Method to return a new group (ie a sub-group of the existing
group) that contains all members of the main group matching
certain header values.

Arguments is a hash that is used for comparison with each
frame.

  $subgrp = $Grp->subgrp(NAME => 'CRL618', CHOP=> 60.0);

The new subgrp is blessed into the same class as $Grp.
All header information (hdr() and uhdr()) is copied
from the main group to the sub-group.

This method is generally used where access to members of the
group by some search criterion is required.

It is possible that the returned group will contain no
members....

If the value looks like a number a numeric comparison will be performed.
Else a string comparison is used.

=item B<subgrps>

Returns frames grouped by the supplied header keys.
A frame can not belong to more than one sub group created by this
method:

   @grps = $Grp->subgrps(@keys);

The groups in @grps are blessed into the same class as $Grp.
For example, if @keys = ('MODE','CHOP') then you can gurantee
that the members of each sub group will have the same values
for MODE and CHOP.

All header information from the main group is copied to the
sub groups.

If a key is not present in the headers then all the frames
will be returned in a single subgrp (since that group guarantees
that the specified header item is not different - it simply
is not there).

The order of the subgroups will match the position of the first
member in the original group.

=cut

sub subgrps {
  my $self = shift;
  my @keys = @_;

  # We can create a unique key in a hash for the header values
  # specified. So create a temporary hash.

=head2 Accessor methods

The following methods are available for accessing the
'instance' data.

=over 4

=cut

# Create some methods to access "instance" data
#
# With args they set the values
# Without args they only retrieve values


=item B<allmembers>

Set or retrieve the array containing the current group membership.

    $Grp->allmembers(@frames);
    @frames = $Grp->allmembers;

The setting function of this routine should only be used
if you know what you are doing (since it completely changes the group
membership). If setting the contents, the check_membership() method
is run automatically so that the list of valid members can remain
synchronized.

All group members are returned regardless of the state of each member.
Use the members() method to return only valid members.

If called in a scalar context, a reference to an array is returned
rather than the array.

  $ref = $Grp->allmembers;
  $first = $Grp->allmembers->[0];

Do not use this array reference to change the contents of the array
directly unless the check_membership() method is run immediately
afterwards. The check_membership() method is responsible for
checking the state of each member and copying them to the members()
array.

=cut

sub allmembers {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    @{ $self->{AllMembers} } = @_;
    $self->check_membership;    # Check valid frames.
  }
  if (wantarray()) {
    return @{ $self->{AllMembers} };
  } else {
    return $self->{AllMembers};
  }
}

=item B<purge_members>

Removes all frames from the group. Can be used to reduce the memory
footprint of the pipeline when a recipe is designed such that it never
needs to go back to the original members. An optional argument may be
given to indicate that the last Frame object should be retained.

  $Grp->purge_members;

  $Grp->purge_members(1);

=cut

sub purge_members {
  my $self = shift;
  # Allows last Frame to be kept
  my $keeplast = 0;
  if ( @_ ) {
    $keeplast = shift;
  }
  if ( $keeplast ) {
    @{$self->{AllMembers}} = ( ($self->members->[-1]) );
  } else {
    @{$self->{AllMembers}} = ();
  }
  $self->check_membership;
  return;
}

=item B<badobs_index>

Return (or set) the index object associate with the bad observation
index file. A index of class B<ORAC::Index::Extern> is used since
this index is modified by an external user/program.

The index is created automatically the first time this method
is invoked.

B<Note:> subclasses may override this method to return C<undef>
in order to disable checking of the bad observation index.

=cut

sub badobs_index {

  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    $self->{BadObsIndex} = shift;
  }

  # If undef we can create a new index object
  unless (defined $self->{BadObsIndex}) {
    my $indexfile = File::Spec->catfile($ENV{'ORAC_DATA_OUT'},"index.badobs");
    my $rulesfile = File::Spec->catfile($ENV{'ORAC_DATA_CAL'},"rules.badobs");

    if (!-e $rulesfile) {
      # Make a default one
      $rulesfile = File::Spec->catfile($ENV{ORAC_DATA_OUT},"rules.badobs");
      if (!-e $rulesfile) {
        orac_warnp("Creating temporary bad observation rules file\n");
        open(my $fh, ">", $rulesfile)
          or orac_throw("Could not create private rules.badobs file: $!");
        print $fh 'ORACUT == $Hdr{ORACUT}'."\n";
        print $fh 'ORACNUM == $Hdr{ORACNUM}'."\n";
        close($fh);
      }
    }

    $self->{BadObsIndex} = new ORAC::Index::Extern($indexfile,$rulesfile);
  }
  ;

  return $self->{BadObsIndex};
}


=item B<coadds>

Return (or set) the array containing the list of frame numbers that have
been coadded into the current group. This is not necessarily the same
as the return of the membernumbers() method since that can return numbers
for all the members of the group even if the full coaddition has not
taken place or the pipeline has been resumed partway through a coaddition
(in which case the coadds array will contain more numbers than are in the
group).

  @coadds = $Grp->coadds;
  $coaddref = $Grp->coadds;
  $Grp->coadds(@numbers);

Returns an array reference in a scalar context, an array in an
array context.

The contents of this array are not automatically written to the
group file when changed, see the coaddspush() or coaddswrite() methods
for further information on object persistence. The array is simply
meant as a storage area for the pipeline.

=cut

sub coadds {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    @{$self->{Coadds}} = @_;
  }
  if (wantarray()) {
    return @{$self->{Coadds}};
  } else {
    return $self->{Coadds};
  }
}



=item B<filesuffix>

Set or retrieve the filename suffix associated with the
reduced group.

    $Grp->filesuffix(".sdf");
    $group_file = $Grp->filesuffix;

=cut

sub filesuffix {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    $self->{FileSuffix} = shift;
  }
  ;
  return $self->{FileSuffix};
}

=item B<fixedpart>

Set or retrieve the part of the group filename that does not
change between invocation. The output filename can be derived using
this.

    $Grp->fixedpart("rg");
    $prefix = $Grp->fixedpart;

=cut


sub fixedpart {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    $self->{FixedPart} = shift;
  }
  ;
  return $self->{FixedPart};
}

=item B<is_frame>

Whether or not the current object is an ORAC::Frame object.

  $is_frame = $self->is_frame;

Returns 0 for Group objects.

=cut

sub is_frame {
  return 0;
}

=item B<members>

Retrieve the array containing the valid objects within the group

    @frames = $Grp->members;

This is the safest way to access the group members
since it only returns valid frames to the caller.

Use the allmembers() method to return all members of the group
regardless of the state of the individual frames.

Group membership should not be set using ths method since that may lead
to a situation where the actual membership of the group does not match the
selected membership. [Valid group membership should only be set from
within this class].

If called in a scalar context, a reference to an array is returned
rather than the array.

  $first = $Grp->members->[0];

=cut

sub members {
  my $self = shift;
  @{ $self->{Members} } = @_ if @_;
  if (wantarray()) {
    return @{ $self->{Members} };
  } else {
    return $self->{Members};
  }
}


# Return/set the current file name of the object
# Make sure that the extension is not present

=item B<name>

Retrieve or set the name of the group.

    $Grp->name("group_name");
    $group_name = $Grp->name;

If no name is set but is retrieved, a name string will be
set automatically based on the first frame in the group.

=cut


sub name {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    $self->{Name} = shift;
  } elsif (!defined $self->{Name}) {
    # make one up if we have enough information
    # Need a frame
    my @allmembers = $self->allmembers;
    if (@allmembers) {
      my $Frm = shift(@allmembers);
      my $number;
      if ( defined( $Frm->uhdr( "ORAC_DR_GROUP" ) ) &&
           $Frm->uhdr( "ORAC_DR_GROUP" ) =~ /^\d+$/ ) {
        $number = $Frm->uhdr( "ORAC_DR_GROUP" );
      } else {
        $number = $Frm->number;
      }
      my $ut = $Frm->hdr("ORACUT");

      my $extra = $Frm->file_from_bits_extra;

      # join, but do not use $extra if it is false
      $self->{Name} = join("#", $ut,$number, ($extra ? $extra : () ) );
    }
  }
  return $self->{Name};
}

=item B<groupid>

Set or retrieve the group identifier. This will
be the string derived from the OBSERVATION_GROUP
header of the first input frame object.

    $Grp->groupid("group_id");
    $group_id = $Grp->groupid;

=head2 General methods

The following methods are provided for manipulating B<ORAC::Group>
objects:

=over 4

=item B<check_membership>

Check whether any of the members of the group have been marked for
removal from the group. The valid group members are copied
to a new array and can be retrieved by the members() method.
Note that all group methods use the list of valid group
members.

This routine is automatically run whenever the group membership
is updated (via the push() or  allmembers() methods. This may
cause too high an overhead with push() in, for example, the
subgrps method).

This method works by looking in a text file created by the
observer in $ORAC_DATA_OUT called index.badobs. This file
contains a list of numbers (two per line) relating to observations
that should be turned off. The first number is the UT date
(YYYYMMDD) and the second number is the observation
number. This is necessary so that ORAC_DATA_OUT can be reused
for a different UT date without worrying about the index file
file turning off incorrect observations.

The UT and observation number are compared with each member of
the group (the full list of members - see allmembers()).
For each group member, the following test is performed to test
for validity. First it is queried to check whether it is in a
good state (ie has been processed successfully).
A frame will be marked as bad if the recipe fails to execute
successfully. If the frame is good (from the pipeline viewpoint)
the UT date and observation number is then compared with the
entries in the index file. If a match can B<NOT> be found the
frame is considered to be valid and is copied to the list of valid
group members (see the members() method).

The format of the index file should be of the form:

 24 19980716
 27 19980716
 43 19980815
 ...

This method returns a list, the first element being an array reference
to the good members, and the second being an array reference to the
bad (or removed) members. Hidden members (negative isgood()) will
not be returned.

        # was bad (the first matching key is returned)
        # Note that we have to make sure that the keys are in

Reads the coadds() information from the current group file and stores
it in the group using the coadds() method.
Should return ORAC__OK if the coadds information was read successfully,
else returns ORAC__ERROR.

This is an abstract method and should be defined by a subclass.

successfully, else returns ORAC__ERROR.

If coadds() contains no entries, all coadds information is removed from
the group file if present.

This is an abstract method and should be defined by a subclass.

=cut

sub coaddswrite {
  print "ERROR: ATTEMPTING TO WRITE COADDS ARRAY USING BASE CLASS\n";
}

=item B<erase>

Erases the group file from disk.

   $Grp->erase;

Returns ORAC__OK if successful, ORAC__ERROR otherwise.

=cut

sub erase {
  my $self = shift;
  my $file = $self->file;
  my $fullname = $self->fullfname( $file );
  my $status = unlink $fullname;

  return ORAC__ERROR if $status == 0;
  return ORAC__OK;
}


=item B<file_exists>

Method to determine whether the group file() exists on disk or not.
Returns true if the file is there, false otherwise. Effectively
equivalent to using C<-e> but allows for the possibility that the
information stored in file() does not directly relate to the
file as stored on disk (e.g. a .sdf extension).

=cut

sub file_exists {
  my $self = shift;
  my $file = $self->file;
  my $fullname = $self->fullfname( $file );
  return (-e $fullname);
}


=item B<file_from_bits>

Method to return the group filename derived from a fixed
variable part (eg UT) and a group designator (usually obs
number). The full filename is returned (including suffix).

  $file = $Grp->file_from_bits("UT","num");

For the base class the return string is of the format

  fixedpart . prefix . '_' . number . suffix

For example, with IRCAM using a UT date of 980104 and observation
number 25 the returned string would be 'rg980104_25.sdf'.

=cut

sub file_from_bits {
  my $self = shift;

  my $prefix = shift;
  my $num = shift;

  # Follow UKIRT style
  return $self->fixedpart . $prefix . '_' . $num . $self->filesuffix;

}

=item B<file_from_name>

Method to return the group filename using the name() method of the
current Group object. The full filename is returned (including
suffix).

  $file = $Grp->file_from_name;

If the name() has not been initialized, then this method returns
undef. Otherwise, it removes all hashes in the string returned by
name() and replaces them with underscores.

The fixedpart() and filesuffix() are prepended and appended,
respectively.

=cut

sub file_from_name {
  my $self = shift;

  if ( ! defined( $self->name ) ) {
    return undef;
  }

  my $name = $self->name;
  $name =~ s/#/_/g;
  return $self->fixedpart . $name . $self->filesuffix;
}

=item B<frame>

Retrieve the nth frame of the group.
Counting starts at 0 as for a standard perl array.

  $Frm = $Grp->frame(2);

This is equivalent to

  $Frm = $Grp->members->[2];

A second argument can be used to set the nth frame.

  $Grp->frame(3, $Frm);

Note that this replaces the nth frame in the list of valid members and
also replaces the equivalent frame in the list of all members of the
group. This is done since the nth valid member is not necessarily the
nth group member. If the supplied position is greater than the current
number of members the supplied frame is simply pushed onto the
array. Remember that just because a frame has been inserted into the
group does not necessarily mean that it will be a valid member
(check_membership() will be run when setting any member of the group).
If the current frame at the specified position can not be found in
allmembers() the supplied frame is pushed onto allmembers() and
membership is re-checked.

=cut

sub frame {

  my $self = shift;

  my $number = shift;

  # Seems that we are setting the value
  # We need to be clever here
  if (@_) {
    my $new = shift;
    # If the number is greater than the current number of members
    # just do a push
    if ($number > scalar(@{$self->members}) ) {
      $self->push($new);
    } else {
      # Retrieve the current member of the group
      my $current = $self->members->[$number];

      # Search through allmembers looking for this frame
      # and replace it
      my $replace = 0;

      if (defined $current) {
        foreach my $frm ($self->allmembers) {
          if ($frm eq $current) {
            $frm = $new;
            $replace = 1;
            last;
          }
        }
      }

      # If we have not found the value push this frame
      # using a low-level push to prevent us running
      # check_membership twice
      push(@{$self->allmembers}, $new) unless $replace;

      # Check membersip
      $self->check_membership;
    }
  }
  # Return the value
  return $self->members->[$number];
}


=item B<members_inout>

Method to return the current filenames for each frame in the
group (similar to the membernames() method) and a set of output
names for each file. This is achieved by calling the inout()
method for each frame in turn. This will fail if the members of the
group do not possess the inout() method.

This method can take two arguments: the new suffix and, optionally,
the file number to use (see the inout() documentation for
B<ORAC::Frame>). References to two arrays are returned when called
in an array context; returns the output array ref when called
from a scalar context

  ($inref, $outref) = $Grp->members_inout("suffix");
  ($inref, $outref) = $Grp->members_inout("suffix",2);
  $outref= $Grp->members_inout("suffix");

=cut

sub members_inout {

  my $self = shift;

  # Find the suffix
  my $suffix = shift;

  # Read the file number if supplied
  my $num = (scalar(@_) ? shift : 1);

  # Initialise the output arrays
  my @in = ();
  my @out = ();

  # Now loop over the members
  foreach my $member ($self->members) {

    # Retrieve the input and output names of these files
    my ($in, $out) = $member->inout($suffix,$num);
    push(@in, $in);
    push(@out, $out);

  }

  # Return the array references
  if (wantarray()) {
    return \@in, \@out;
  } else {
    return \@out;
  }
}

=item B<firstmember>

Method to determine whether the supplied argument matches the first
member of the group. Returns a 1 if it is the first member and a zero
otherwise.

  $isfirst = $Grp->firstmember( $Frm );

=cut

sub firstmember {
  my $self = shift;
  my $member = shift;

  if ( $member eq $self->frame(0)) {
    return 1;
  }

  return 0;
}

=item B<lastmember>

Method to determine whether the supplied argument
matches the last good member of the group. Returns a 1 if
it is the last member and a zero otherwise.

   $islast = $Grp->lastmember($Frm);

If there are no good members in the group, returns false.

=cut

sub lastmember {
  my $self = shift;
  my $member = shift;

  my $num = $self->num;
  return 0 if $num == -1;

  if ($member eq $self->frame($self->num)) {
    return 1;
  }

  return 0;
}

=item B<lastallmembers>

Method to determine whether the supplied argument matches the last
member of the group. This method differs from lastmember() in that
this method does not care about badness, i.e., it looks at the
allmembers() list instead of the members() list.

Returns true if the supplied argument is the last member, and false
otherwise.

=cut

sub lastallmembers {
  my $self = shift;
  my $member = shift;
  my @allmembers = $self->allmembers;
  if ( $member eq $allmembers[-1] ) {
    return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}

=item B<memberindex>

Given a frame, determines what position this frame has in the
group. This is useful in Batch mode processing where the
groups are pre-populated.

  $index = $Grp->memberindex( $Frm );

Index starts counting at 0 (see the C<frame> method)
and refers only to valid members rather than all members.
If the frame is not in the group, returns undef.

=cut

sub memberindex {
  my $self = shift;
  my $member = shift;

  my $index;
  for my $i (0..$self->num) {
    if ($member eq $self->frame( $i )) {
      $index = $i;
      last;
    }
  }
  return $index;
}

=item B<membernames>

Return a list of all the files associated with the group. This is
achieved by invoking the file() method for each object stored in the
Members array.  For this to work each member must be an object capable
of invoking the file() method (e.g. B<ORAC::Frame>). Currently the
routine does not check to make sure this is possible - the program
will die if you try to use a SCALAR member.

If an argument list is given the file names for each member of the
group are updated. This will only be attempted if the number of
arguments given matches the number of members in the group.

  $Grp->membernames(@newnames);
  @names = $Grp->membernames;

Only the first file from each frame object is returned.

=cut

sub membernames {

  my $self = shift;

  # If arguments are supplied use the values to update the
  # filenames in each frame
  if (@_) {
    # Only attempt this if the number of arguments supplied matches
    # The number of members in the group
    if ($self->num == $#_) {
      foreach my $member ($self->members) {
        my $newname = shift;
        $member->file($newname);
      }
    }

  }

  # Now return the list of names associated with each member
  my @list = ();
  foreach my $member ($self->members) {

    push(@list, $member->file);

  }
  return @list;
}

=item B<membernumbers>

Return a list of all the observation numbers associated with
the group. This is achieved by invoking the number() method for
each object stored in the Members array.
For this to work each member must be an object capable of invoking
numbers() (e.g. B<ORAC::Frame>). Currently the routine does not check
to make sure this is possible - the program will die if you try
to use a SCALAR member.

  @numbers = $Grp->membernumbers;

=cut

sub membernumbers {

  my $self = shift;

  my @list = ();
  foreach my $member ($self->members) {

    push(@list, $member->number);

  }
  return @list;
}

=item B<membertagset>

Set the tag in each of the members.

  $Grp->membertagset( 'TAG' );

Runs the C<tagset> method on each of the member frames.

Note that $Grp->tagset() is used for the group filenames
not the input files from Frame objects.

=cut

sub membertagset {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    foreach my $member ($self->members) {
      $member->tagset($_[0]);
    }
  }
}

=item B<membertagretrieve>

Run the C<tagretrieve()> method for each of the members.

  $Grp->membertagretrieve

Note that $Grp->tagretrieve() is used for the group filenames
not the input files from Frame objects.

=cut

sub membertagretrieve {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    foreach my $member ($self->members) {
      $member->tagretrieve($_[0]);
    }
  }
}

# Method to return the number of frames in a group
# Same style as for $#array.

=item B<num>

Return the number of frames in a group minus one.
This is identical to the $# construct.

  $number_of_frames = $Grp->num;

=cut

sub num {
  my $self = shift;
  return $#{$self->members};
}



# Method to push data onto the group
# Multiple members can be added in one go

=item B<push>

Method to push an observation into the group. Multiple observations
can be pushed on at once (see L<perl> "push()" command).

  $Grp->push("observation2");
  $Grp->push(@obs);

There are no return arguments.

=cut

sub push {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    push(@{ $self->allmembers }, @_);
    # Check frame membership
    $self->check_membership;
  }
}

=item B<template>

Method to change all the current filenames in the group so that they
match the supplied template. This method invokes the template()
method for each member of the group.

  $Grp->template("filename_template");

A second argument can be specified to modify the specified frame
number rather than simply the first (see the template() method
in B<ORAC::Frame> for more details):

  $Grp->template($template,2);

There are no return arguments. The intelligence for this method resides
in the individual frame objects.

=cut

sub template {
  my $self = shift;

  # Loop over the members
  foreach my $member ($self->members) {
    $member->template(@_);
  }
}


=item B<updateout>

This method updates the current filename of each member of the group
when supplied with a suffix (and optionally, a file number -- see the
inout() method in B<ORAC::Frame> for more information). The inout()
method (of the individual frame) is invoked for each member to
generate the output name.

  $Grp->updateout("suffix");
  $Grp->updateout("suffix", 5);

This can be used to update the member filenames after an operation
has been applied to every file in the group. Alternatively the
membernames() method can be invoked with the output of the inout()
method.

=cut

sub updateout {
  my $self = shift;
  my $suffix = shift;

  # Read the file number if supplied
  my $num = (scalar(@_) ? shift : 1);

  # Now loop over the members
  foreach my $member ($self->members) {

    my ($in, $out) = $member->inout($suffix,$num);
    $member->file($out);
  }

  return 1;
}



#=item reduce
#
#Method to return all members of the group that should be processed
#during the current pipeline loop. Currently this always returns
#the last member of the group (ie most recent addition).
#The intention is that this method is modified when necessary so that
#it returns a list of all frames that should be rereduced
#
#=cut
#
#sub reduce {
#  my $self = shift;


#
#  return $self->frame($self->num);
#
#}

=head1 DISPLAY COMPATIBILITY

These methods are provided for compatibility with the ORAC display
system.

=over 4

=item B<gui_id>

Returns the identification string that is used to compare the
current frame with the frames selected for display in the
display definition file.

In the default case, this method returns everything after the
last suffix stored in file().

In some derived implementation of this method an argument
may be used so that multiple IDs can be extracted from objects
that contain more than one output file per observation.

=cut

sub gui_id {
  my $self = shift;

  my $gui_id = $self->SUPER::gui_id( @_ );

  return "g_$gui_id";
}
