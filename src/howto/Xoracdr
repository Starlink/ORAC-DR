=head1 NAME

Xoracdr - an ORAC-DR HOWTO

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ORAC-DR pipeline can be controlled from the Xoracdr
application. This note describes the user interface of Xoracdr and how
to use it.

=head1 STARTING XORACDR

The ORAC-DR pipeline and Xoracdr software uses a number of
environmental variables for configuration. For non-Starlink, non-JAC
installation of ORAC-DR, please consult L<ShellVariables> (see
appendix) for more information.

To start the Xoracdr application type C<xoracdr> at the prompt:

  % xoracdr
  ORAC Data Reduction Pipeline -- (ORAC-DR Version 3.0)

  Please wait, spawning Xoracdr...

this will run the Xoracdr setup script and bring up the Xoracdr main window.

=head1 OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS

Unlike command line control of the ORAC-DR pipeline, configuration of
the pipeline options is via the main window. There are therefore only
a few command line options

=over 4

=item B<-vers>

Displays revision information about Xoracdr and the version of Perl it
is using.

=item B<-ut> I<YYYYMMDD>

UT date of observations (defaults to current YYYYMMDD).The UT is
required for UKIRT and JCMT instruments as it forms part of the file
naming convention for data files.

=item B<-honour>

If you start xoracdr with the C<ORAC_INSTRUMENT> environment variable
unset, i.e. you have not run one of the instrument setup scripts, but
have the C<ORAC_DATA_OUT> environment variable set you may wish to
force Xoracdr to honour this using the C<-honour> command line option.

=back

=head1 USING XORACDR

If your data conforms to the directory naming convention for the
instrument, setting up the pipeline is fairly trivial.

Select your instrument from the list box to the left hand side of the
application main window and then enter the UT date of the observations
you are reducing into the entry field in the center of the main
window. The raw and reduced data paths should now be set
correctly. Enter the range of frame numbers that you are interested in
into the C<List> text entry and push the C<Start ORAC-DR> button. The
pipeline should initalise and start processing you data immediately.

A more detailed description of the Xoracdr user interface follows for
those people who need to do something slightly out of the ordinary,
although the interface itself should be fairly self explanatory for
those people used to the L<oracdr> command line interface.

=head1 THE MAIN WINDOW

The Xoracdr main window is divided into three main sections. At the
top is the menu bar with C<File>, C<Display>, C<Options>, C<Recipe>
and C<Help> menus.

=begin latex

\end{center}
\end{figure}

=end latex

=over 4

=item File Menu

=over 4

=item Stop Processing

When the pipeline is running further data processing can be halted by
selecting this menu entry. Control will be returned to the main
window, processing can be restarted from the beginning by depressing
the I<Start ORAC-DR> button.

=item Pause Processing

When the pipeline is running the processing of further data can be
paused by selecting this menu item, a pop-up window will appear with a
I<Resume> button. Processing can be re-started by depressing the
I<Resume> button in the pop-up.

=item Nuke ORAC-DR

Selecting this menu option will kill all ORAC-DR related processes,
including spawned Starlink monoliths, and will free up any shared
memory used by these processes. This will also kill the Xoracdr
graphical user interface.

=back

=item Display Menu

=over 4

=item No Display

Selecting this checkbox will instruct Xoracdr not to launch the
display system. No data will be displayed and GWM (or GAIA) windows
will not be launched.

=item Configure Display

Allows configuration of the ORAC-DR display environment. Selecting
this menu item will display a popup window which can be used to edit
the current environment and add display directives to the current
environment. This popup can also be run as a stand alone application
from the command line, e.g.

  % oracdisp

for more information on how to use the display environment editor see
the L<oracdisp> documentation and the documentation on the
L<DisplaySystem>.

=back

=item Options Menu

=over 4

=item Allow Resume

Allow the pipeline to resume midway through the processing of a group
so long as the recipe/instrument supports this behaviour. Default is
for the group file to be deleted when a new group is created. When
this menu option is selected, the group file is retained. B<NOTE> this
option is not currently supported by IRCAM, UFTI and SCUBA recipes.

=item No Engines

Do not start algorithm engines. B<NOTE> this will cause the vast
majority of recipes to fail.

=item Common ADAM

Do not create an invocation specific temporary directory for the
messaging systems but use whatever directory is the usual default. For
ADAM tasks this would mean that ~/adam or C<$ADAM_USER> will be used
rather than a private ORAC-DR directory. This should only be used when
it is required for ORAC-DR to talk to tasks that were not started by
the pipeline and could lead to possible confusion if multiple
pipelines are running using this flag.

=item Verbose

If selected then messages from the Starlink engines will be printed in
addition to the normal ORAC-DR messages

=item Debug

Log debug messages to file C<ORACDR.DEBUG> in C<$ORAC_DATA_OUT>.

=item Warn

Turn on perl level warning messages (C<perl -w>). This should be used
for debugging only. If C<-verbose> is also true then full perl
diagnostics are turned on (see L<diagnostics> for more information on
this perl pragma).

=item Beep

Is selected the pipeline will make as much noise as possible over
errors and pipeline exit.

=item Setup Environment

If selected a window will appear allowing you to enter file paths for
the data and calibration root directories, user recipe and primitive
directories, the raw and reduced data directories and the instrument
calibration directory. If these have already been set, either by
selecting an instrument from the listbox or from environment variables
you can override the default options using this popup window. B<NOTE>
The raw and reduced data paths will be overridden if you select an
instrument from the main window listbox after entering values into
this window.

=item Calibration Options

This item will remain disabled until an instrument is selected in the
main window listbox, after this you are free to select this item from
the menu. On selection a window will popup allowing you to enter
calibration options for the instrument, see the user guide for your
instrument for more information.

=back

=item Recipe Menu

=over 4

=item Show Current Recipe

Selecting this menu item will ensure that the recipe display window
will appear along with the log window. The recipe display window will
show the currently executing recipe and a list of the primitives
contained in the recipe. The currently running primitive will be
highlighted.

=item Override: I<RECIPE>

This item will be greyed out until an override recipe is selected
using the I<Override Recipe> option further down the C<Recipe>
menu. After an override recipe is selected then this option will
become active. If the checkbox is selected then the selected recipe
will override the one specified in the file headers. This override
recipe is used for all data files regardless of header contents or
observation mode, so make sure you only only apply it to appropriate
data frames.

=item Set Override Recipe

This item will remain disabled until an instrument is selected in the
main window listbox, after which if selected it will allow you to
choose an I<Override Recipe>

=item Edit Recipe

Allows you to select and then edit a recipe. The recipe will be saved
to C<ORAC_RECIPE_DIR>, the user recipe directory, which if unset will
default to C<ORAC_DATA_OUT>. Recipes in C<ORAC_RECIPE_DIR> will be run
in preference to those in the instrument recipe directories of the
same name.

=back

=item Help Menu

Selecting an entry from the C<Help> menu will popup a help browser to
display the relevant documentation. At the bottom on the menu there is
also an C<About XORAC-DR> entry which will display the licence terms
and conditions for the ORAC-DR software.

=back

At the bottom of the main window is the status bar, this reports the
status of the pipeline process. It will display the currently running
recipe name, along with other status information.

Between the menu and status bar is the bulk of the main window. On the
left is the instrument list box, this allows you to select the
instrument whose data you wish to process. If the C<ORAC_INSTRUMENT>
environment variable is set before starting Xoracdr the instrument
will be preselected on startup.

Once an instrument is selected the user interface will be configured
into a default state for the instrument. B<NOTE> it is important to
select an instrument before doing any customization of the settings as
your changes may be overridden by the default options imposed by
setting up an instrument.

At this point the I<Start ORAC-DR> button will become enabled and you
can start the pipeline if the configuration options are to your
liking.

=head1 FURTHER CONFIGURATION

If not already set using the C<-ut> command line option, and if you
are using a loop type where it is necessary to build the filename
using the UT date (i.e. all loop options except I<file>) the UT date
of the observation run can be set via the relevant text entry box in
the middle of the main window. B<NOTE> Doing so will run the
instrument setup routine again which will override some environment
options such as C<ORAC_DATA_IN> and C<ORAC_DATA_OUT>.

If ORAC-DR is being run in post-observation mode, the default data
detection loop is I<list>. Other loop options can be selected using
the series of checkboxes along the bottom of the main window. The
available options are

=over 4

=item  B<list>

The pipeline will stop once the observations in the list have been
reduced.

=item  B<wait>

Waits for data to appear before timing out. Data is reduced and the
pipeline waits for the next file.

=item  B<inf>

Do not wait for data. Simply reduce data starting with observation
specified by C<from> and continuing until no more files are present.
This is the fastest way of reducing data offline.

=item  B<flag>

Waits for completion files to appear (flags) before processing the
data.  Data is reduced and the pipeline waits for more data by
checking the presence of a flag.

=item B<file>

Works much like the C<list> loop option except that looping is carried
out over a list of arbitrarily named files. When the C<file> loop option
is selected the I<Select Files> button will be enabled allowing you to
generate this list. B<NOTE> As well as having arbitrary filenames,
files can be added in arbitrary order, this allows you to reduces (for
instance) all the calibration frames for a night first, followed by
the actual observations.

=back

There are, in addition, two other options which affect the looping
scheme, these being C<batch> and C<skip>.

=over 4

=item B<batch>

Run in batch mode. Precalculate groups before processing data. `wait'
loop mode should not be used with this option.  B<NOTE> only SCUBA
recipes support this option.

=item B<skip>

Allow the data detection loop to skip missing observations. Default is
to stop the loop when an expected file can not be found.

=back

See the L<DataLoops> documentation for more information on looping
schemes.

=head1 LOG OPTIONS

Finally, you can configure the log options from the three checkboxes
located to the right hand side of the main window. By default logging
is sent to a file and to an Xwindow.
