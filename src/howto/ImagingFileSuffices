Files generated during imaging data reduction have suffices denoting the
processing step that created them.  This note contains a list with
short descriptions of what they mean.

 Suffix  Stands for               Description

 _adu    ADU                      Multiplied by the exposure time to convert
                                  the units to ADU (Michelle)
 _bc     Bias Corrected           Resdiual bias variations removed (ISAAC)
 _bgl    BackGround Limited       Whether or not each pixel is background
                                  limited, i.e. Poisson noise exceeds the
                                  read noise

 _db     De-Biassed               The bias is actually zero, but it sets
				  up various CCDPACK ancillary data for later
				  processing

                                  of nodded data, as used by NOD_CHOP recipes

         Applied

 _fm     Flat Masked              This has the flagged deviant pixels detected
                                  by the initial flat-field creation restored
                                  after object masking.
 _fpm    Fabry Perot Masked       After a mask is applied to exclude regions
                                  beyond the circle transmitted by the
                                  Fabry-Perot etalon.
 _md     Masked Deviants          Deviant pixels from the neighbourhood
                                  (usually 3 sigma in 15x15) flagged as bad
 _nl     Non-Linearity            The standard non-linearity correction has
                                  been applied (IRCAM only)
 _nm     Normalised to Mode       Normalised masked frames combined to make
                                  the flat field
 _om     Objects Masked           This has sources masked with bad values
                                  so that they do not bias the self flat
				  field
 _oss    O-beam Sky Subtracted    Polarimetry target o-beam after sky subtraction
 _pov    POisson Variance         Poisson variance added
 _qm     Quadrant Masked          One of the quadrants is masked with bad
                                  pixels, created in QUADRANT_JITTER
 _raw    Raw copy                 Copy of the raw data, but in output directory
                                  and has history recording enabled
 _rnv    Read Noise Variance      Variance created containing the readnoise
 _ss     Sky Subtracted           Global or local sky subtraction applied
 _th     THresholded              Non-physical values in dark-subtracted
                                  frame set to bad
 _trn    TRaNsform                The transformed/resampled data immediately
 				  prior to making a mosaic
