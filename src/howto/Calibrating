=head1 NAME

The ORAC-DR Calibration Selection - an ORAC-DR HOWTO

=head2 Description

ORAC-DR has a totally flexible system for controlling the automatic
selection of calibration frames.  This note describes how it works and
how to override it

=head2 What happens

The type of calibrations used depend, obviously, on the instrument and
the data reduction recipes used. Typically there are three kinds of
calibration frames:

=over 4

=item *

Library frames provided by the observatory (bad pixel masks, rotation
transformations, etc).  These are maintained by the instrument
scientist as appropriate.  They are located in C<ORAC_DATA_CAL>.

=item *

Nightly frames that are generated during observing.  The may be taken
in specific calibration observations, e.g. by taking a ``dark'' (at UKIRT)
or ``skydip'' (at JCMT) frames.  They might also be generated from
actual observations of targets (such as ``sky flats'') or
calibration values (such as ``flux conversion factors'') calculated
as part of a recipe.  These are located in C<ORAC_DATA_OUT>.

=item *

``Rule'' files that contain the rules for what constitutes an
appropriate calibration frame.  These are located in C<ORAC_DATA_CAL>.

=back

ORAC-DR treats the first two kinds rather differently.

Library frames reside C<ORAC_DATA_CAL> and their selection is hardwired
either in the instrument class or in a DR primitive.  The users are
unlikely to be concerned with them unless they want to override them
with their own.

Nightly frames are handled in a more complicated way.  A DR recipe
that generates a calibration frame is responsible for filing it with
the pipeline.  The pipeline will hand it back to recipes that require
calibration recipes according to a set of rules that are defined on a
per-instrument basis by the ORAC-DR infrastructure as well as a
per-frame basis by the calibration rules files.

=head2 Finding calibration frames

When a frame is reduced and files as a calibration, it is added to an
index file located in C<ORAC_DATA_OUT> named after the type of
calibration, e.g., dark frames are filed in F<index.dark>.  When the
pipeline is run up and needs a calibration frame but has not been
asked to reduce one in that session it will look in the index files
for one that may have been reduced at a previous time.

If the pipeline is unable to find a suitable calibration it will
complain vociferously and exit.  This may seem extreme, but remember
that ORAC-DR is designed for online use at an observatory.  If an
observer has not taken appropriate calibrations, we wish to point it
out to them in the strongest terms because we do not want them to end
up with un-reduceable data.


=head2 Overriding defaults

You can override the pipeline's selection of calibration frame by
using the ORAC-DR C<-calib> command line option.  Use this override
judiciously, as in general the pipeline does a fine job.

The ORAC-DR C<-calib> command line option is used by giving comma
separated key=value pairs (e.g. 'C<-calib dark=file1,bias=file2>').
The following keys can be used for general instruments.  Specific
instruments may have extra calibration overrides that can be used.

=over 4

=item *

baseshift - Use the given comma separated doublet (e.g. C<"0,0">)
as the frame's base position.

=item *

bias - Use the given frame as a bias.

=item *

dark - Use the given frame as a dark.

=item *

flat - Use the given frame as a flat.

=item *

mask - Use the given frame as a mask. This option is usually used
for bad pixel masks.

=item *

polrefang - Add the given value to the measured polarisation angle
to align the polarimeter's reference angle to north.

=item *

readnoise - Use the given value for the detector readnoise.

=item *

referenceoffset - Use the given comma separated doublet (e.g.
C<"0,0">) as the frame's reference offset, which is difference between
the frame centre and the reference pixel derived from the FITS
headers.

=item *

rotation - Use the given frame as a rotation matrix.

=item *

sky - Use the given frame as a sky observation.

=item *

standard - Use the given frame as a standard star observation.

=back

When files are given the extension should be left off.  As an example,
if you have made a new bad pixel mask and wish to use it with ORAC-DR,
the following command would be used:

 oracdr -calib mask=new_bpm
