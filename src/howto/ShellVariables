Shell Variables - an ORAC-DR HOWTO

=head2 Description

This document describes the complete list of environment variables
used by the pipeline.

=head1 Complete variable list

ORAC-DR uses a number of environment variables for configuration.

=head2 User variables

Users may need to change the following variables before using the
software.

=over 4

=item C<ORAC_DATA_ROOT>

Location of the raw and reduced data directories if it confirms with
the naming convention for the instrument. Should be set before the
instrument startup script, which uses this variable to set
C<ORAC_DATA_IN> and C<ORAC_DATA_OUT>.

=item C<ORAC_DATA_IN>

Actual location of raw data files. Should be set after the instrument
startup script.

=item C<ORAC_DATA_OUT>

Actual location of reduced data files. This is also the working
directory of the pipeline. Should be set after the instrument startup
script.

=item C<ORAC_CAL_ROOT>

Directory where the instrument specific

=item C<ORAC_DATA_CAL>

Location of the calibration files for the instrument. Set by the
instrument startup script to C<ORAC_CAL_ROOT/E<lt>instrumentE<gt>>.

=item C<ORAC_RECIPE_DIR>

Location of user-defined recipes. These supersede any identically
names ones in C<ORAC_DIR/recipes/E<lt>instrumentE<gt>>.


=item C<ORAC_PRIMITIVE_DIR>

Location of user-defined primitives. These supersede any identically
names ones in C<ORAC_DIR/primitives/E<lt>instrumentE<gt>>.

=item C<ORACDR_TMP>

Location of scratch files for the ADAM messaging system. If this
environment variable is not set, then this location will default to
C<ORAC_DATA_OUT>.

=item C<ORAC_NOGROUPS>

If set, group processing will be disabled.

=item C<ORAC_KEEP>

If set, all intermediate files created by ORAC-DR will be kept.
This does not include temporary files; to keep temporary files
run ORAC-DR with the C<-debug> flag.

=item C<ORACDR_PROXY>

If set, ORAC-DR will use a proxy for network lookups. This variable
should be set to the full proxy name, including the protocol, name,
and port. An example of this is "http://proxy.example.com:8181".

=head2 System variables

Starlink and JAC users should not redefine these variables under
normal circumstances because they are correctly set by their user
logins. They are included here for reference only.

=over 4

=item C<ORAC_DIR>

The location of the ORAC-DR software directory. This is normally set
by a login script.

=item C<ORAC_INSTRUMENT>

The instrument under whose environment ORAC-DR should run. Normally
this is set by the appropriate instrument script in C<ORAC_DIR/etc/>

=item C<ORAC_PERL5LIB>

The location of the ORAC-DR perl libraries. These are normally in
C<ORAC_DIR/lib/perl5>.

=item C<ORAC_PERSON>

The e-mail address of the person who supports ORAC-DR for
C<$ORAC_INSTRUMENT>. This is used in the splash screen.
(This was formerly the JAC contact name and assumed a JAC
e-mail address C<$ORAC_PERSON@jach.hawaii.edu>.)

=item C<ORAC_LOOP>

The default type of looping scheme that should be used for online
reduction of C<ORAC_INSTRUMENT>. This  is used in the splash screen.

=item C<ORAC_SUN>

The Starlink User Note number that documents the data reduction for
C<ORAC_INSTRUMENT>. This  is used in the splash screen.
