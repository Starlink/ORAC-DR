The ORAC-DR Data Loops - an ORAC-DR HOWTO

=head2 Description

ORAC-DR may use a variety of ways to detect available data. This
document describes what they mean and when to use them.

=head2 How the pipeline operates

ORAC-DR is a data-driven pipeline. This means that it does things in
response to incoming data and uses the information associated with
that data to determine how to process a file. It is also a sequential
(i.e. non-parallel) process. This means it only does one thing at a
time. As a result, ORAC-DR is always doing one of two things

=over 4

=item *

Seeks new data

=item *

Reduces data

=head2 How the pipeline detects new data

Unless the C<-files> option is used, the pipeline starts from looking for observation number 1, unless another number has been specified via the
C<-from> or C<-list> options.

The various C<-loop> options determine what the criterion is for
concluding that the observation it is waiting for has indeed arrived.

=over 4

=item -loop wait

If you use this option, the pipeline monitors the size of the file
that is is expecting. For example, if it has just reduced observation
number 41, it waits for observation number 42 to appear on disk and
watches it size growing as it is being written out by the data
handling system. If the file does not grow in size for a certain
amount of time it concluded that readout is complete and proceeds with
reducing it. Obviously this method is not very robust if the pipeline
is operating or network-mounted disks or with acquisition systems that
are prone to stalling during readout. However it may be the only
option for online data reduction with some data handling systems. This
option should be used with IRCAM.

=item -loop flag

This option instructs the pipeline to monitor not the data file
itself, but a ``flag'' file whose appearance indicates readout
completion. Typically this is a zero-length file written by the data
acquisition after the data file writing is done. This is most robust
in architectures where there is no chance of a data file being written
without a flag file or vice versa. This option should be used with SCUBA,
UFTI, the WFS and MICHELLE.

=item -loop inf

Under this option, the pipeline reduces data assuming it is available
and keeps going one observation at a time until no more data is to be
found (or infinity, whichever comes first!), at which point it
terminates. It overrides the C<-to> option. This is suitable for offline
data reduction of any instrument and is the default option if none is
specified.

=item -loop list

The specified data frames (and/or range of observations) are assumed
to be available, are reduced and then the pipeline exits. This option
is implied by usage of the C<-list> option, or usage of the C<-from>
and C<-to> options in the same invocation. It is unlikely that a user
will need to explicitly specify it.

=item -loop file

The specified data frames are assumed available, are reduced and then
the pipeline exists. This option is impled by usage of the C<-files>
option. Which provides a filename (relative to the current directory) of
a flat ASCII text file containing a list of observation I<files> to be
reduced, one filename per line. The filenames, unlike other loop options
used by ORAC-DR, are not based on UT date and may be arbitarily constructed.
