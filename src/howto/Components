ORAC-DR Components - an ORAC-DR HowTo

=head1 Description

This document describes the executables that form part of the ORAC-DR
distribution.

=head1 Set up scripts

These are the commands you have to type to set up ORAC-DR for the various
supported instruments.

=over 4

=item C<oracdr_cgs4>

Sets up for the data reduction of CGS4.

=item C<oracdr_ircam>

Sets up for the data reduction of IRCAM, the UKIRT Infrared Camera.

=item C<oracdr_michelle>

Sets up for the data reduction of MICHELLE.

=item C<oracdr_scuba>

Sets up for the data reduction of SCUBA, the JCMT Submillimetre Common
User Bolometer Array.

=item C<oracdr_ufti>

Sets up for the data reduction of UFTI (the UKIRT Fast Track Imager)

=item C<oracdr_iris2>

Sets up for the data reduction of IRIS-2 (the AAT Infrared Imaging
Spectrograph)

=item C<oracdr_uist>

Sets up the data-reduction system for UIST (The UKIRT infrared
imaging spectrometer with IFU).

=item C<oracdr_ingrid>

Sets up the data reduction system for INGRID.

=item C<oracdr_isaac>

Sets up the data-reduction system for ESO ISAAC in imaging modes.
Support for spectroscopy modes is ongoing.

=item C<xoracdr>

Initialises the environment and then launches the ORAC-DR GUI.

=head1 Executables

=over 4

=item C<oracdr>

Runs the pipeline. For more information see L<oracdr>

=item C<oracman>

Displays man-page information for all ORAC-DR executables, recipes,
primitives and how-to guides. Type:

 oracman <foo>

for documentation, e.g.

 oracman oracdr
 oracman ARRAY_TESTS
 oracman _SUBTRACT_DARK_
 oracman DisplaySystem

=item C<oracdisp>

Sets up the X display configuration tool. For more information on
C<oracdisp> and the display system see L<oracdisp> and L<DisplaySystem>

=item C<oracdr_nuke>

Kills C<oracdr>, any related processes (including any Starlink
processes), and clears shared memory owned by the user. Useful if
something happens to cause ORAC-DR to hang. See L<oracdr_nuke>
